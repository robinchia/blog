[]()[]()Preface

CMMI® (Capability Maturity Model® Integration) is a process improvement maturity model for the development of products and services. It consists of best practices that address development and maintenance activities that cover the product lifecycle from conception through delivery and maintenance.

This latest iteration of the model as represented herein integrates bodies of knowledge that are essential for development and maintenance, but that have been addressed separately in the past, such as software engineering, systems engineering, hardware and design engineering, the engineering “-ilities,” and acquisition. The prior designations of CMMI for systems engineering and software engineering (CMMI-SE/SW) are superseded by the title “CMMI for Development” to truly reflect the comprehensive integration of these bodies of knowledge and the application of the model within the organization. CMMI for Development (CMMI-DEV) provides a comprehensive integrated solution for development and maintenance activities applied to products and services.

CMMI for Development, Version 1.2 is a continuation and update of CMMI version 1.1 and has been facilitated by the concept of CMMI “constellations” wherein a set of core components can be augmented by additional material to provide application-specific models with highly common content. CMMI-DEV is the first of such constellations and represents the development area of interest.
[Purpose]()

The purpose of CMMI for Development is to help organizations improve their development and maintenance processes for both products and services. CMMI for Development is a collection of best practices that is generated from the CMMI Framework.[[1]]() The CMMI Framework supports the CMMI Product Suite by allowing multiple models, training courses, and appraisal methods to be generated that support specific areas of interest.

A constellation is a collection of CMMI components that includes a model, its training materials, and appraisal-related documents for an area of interest. Currently there are three planned constellations supported by the version 1.2 model framework: development, services, and acquisition. “Additions” are used to expand constellations for specific additional content.

This document contains the CMMI for Development constellation and contains both the base CMMI-DEV as well as CMMI-DEV with the IPPD addition (CMMI-DEV+IPPD).

If you are not using IPPD, ignore the information that is marked “IPPD Addition,” and you will be using the CMMI for Development model.

Unlike CMMI version 1.1, there is but a single model document that describes both the staged and continuous approaches to process improvement versus the prior use of two representations of staged and continuous in separate documents. This consolidated presentation of model material for both approaches was first used in the book, CMMI: Guidelines for Process Integration and Product Improvement. Thanks to Peter Gordon, publishing partner at Addison-Wesley Professional, and the book’s authors, Mary Beth Chrissis, Mike Konrad, and Sandy Shrum, we were able to use the book’s manuscript as the basis for developing CMMI version 1.2 [Chrissis 2003].
[Acknowledgments]()

Many talented people were involved as part of the product team for the CMMI v1.2 Product Suite. Three primary groups involved in this development were the Steering Group, Product Team, and Configuration Control Board.

The Steering Group guides and approves the plans of the Product Team, provides consultation on significant CMMI project issues, and ensures involvement from a variety of interested communities.

The Product Team writes, reviews, revises, discusses, and agrees on the structure and technical content of the CMMI Product Suite, including the framework, models, training, and appraisal materials. Development activities are based on multiple inputs. These inputs include an A-Specification and guidance specific to each release provided by the Steering Group, source models, change requests received from the user community, and input received from pilots and other stakeholders [SEI 2004].

The Configuration Control Board is the official mechanism for controlling changes to the CMMI models and Introduction to CMMI training. As such, this group ensures integrity over the life of the product suite by reviewing all proposed changes to the baseline and approving only those changes that satisfy the identified issues and meet the criteria for the upcoming release.

Members of these groups that were involved in developing CMMI v1.2, are listed in Appendix C.
[Audience]()

The audience for this model includes anyone interested in process improvement in a development and maintenance environment. Whether you are familiar with the concept of Capability Maturity Models or whether you are seeking information to get started on your improvement efforts, this document will be useful to you.

This model is also intended for people who want to use an appraisal[[2]]() to see where they are, those who already know what they want to improve, and those who are just getting started and want to develop a general understanding of the CMMI for Development constellation.
[Organization of This Document]()

This document is available on the SEI Web site[[3]]() and serves as a guide for improvement of organizational processes. It is organized into three main parts:

·         Part One—About CMMI for Development

·         Part Two—Generic Goals and Generic Practices, and the Process Areas

·         Part Three—The Appendices and Glossary

Part One, “About CMMI for Development,” consists of five chapters:

·         Chapter 1, “Introduction,” offers a broad view of CMMI and the CMMI for Development constellation. It introduces you to the concepts of process improvement, and describes the history of models used for process improvement and different process improvement approaches.

·         Chapter 2, “Process Area Components,” describes all of the components of the CMMI for Development process areas.

·         Chapter 3, “Tying It All Together,” assembles the model components and explains the concepts of maturity levels and capability levels.

·         Chapter 4, “Relationships among Process Areas,” provides insight into the meaning and interactions of the CMMI for Development process areas.

·         Chapter 5, “Using CMMI Models,” describes paths to adoption and use of CMMI for process improvement and benchmarking.

Part Two, “Generic Goals and Generic Practices, and the Process Areas,” contains all of the CMMI for Development constellation’s required and expected components. It also contains related informative components, including component names, subpractices, notes, and typical work products.

Part Two contains 23 sections. The first section contains the generic goals and practices, including a description of how they are used and how they relate to the process areas. The remaining 22 sections each represent one of the CMMI for Development process areas.[[4]]() To make these process areas easy to find, they are organized alphabetically by process area acronym. Each section contains descriptions of goals, best practices, and examples.

Part Three, “The Appendices and Glossary,” consists of four information resources:

·         Appendix A, “References,” contains references you can use to locate documented sources of information such as reports, process improvement models, industry standards, and books that are related to CMMI for Development.

·         Appendix B, “Acronyms,” defines the acronyms used herein.

·         Appendix C, “CMMI for Development Project Participants,” contains lists of people and their organizations who participated in the development of CMMI for Development, Version 1.2.

·         The “Glossary” defines many of the terms used in CMMI.
[How to Use This Document]()

Whether you are new to process improvement, new to CMMI, or already familiar with CMMI, Part One can help you understand why CMMI for Development is the best model to use for improving your development and maintenance processes.

[Readers New to Process Improvement]()

If you are new to process improvement or new to the CMM® concept, we suggest that you read Chapter 1, “Introduction,” first. Chapter 1 will give you an overview of process improvement and explain what CMMI is all about.

Next, skim Part Two, including generic goals and practices as well as specific goals and practices, to get a feel for the scope of the best practices contained in the model. Pay closest attention to the purpose and introductory notes at the beginning of each section.

In Part Three, look through the references in Appendix A and select additional sources you think would be beneficial to read before moving forward with using CMMI for Development. Read through the acronyms and glossary to become familiar with the language of CMMI. Then, go back and read the details of Part Two.
[Readers Experienced with Process Improvement]()

If you are new to CMMI but have experience with other process improvement models, such as the Software CMM (version 1.1) or the Systems Engineering Capability Model (i.e., EIA 731), you will immediately recognize many similarities [EIA 1998].

We recommend that you read Part One to understand how CMMI is different from other process improvement models, but you may want to read some of the sections more quickly than others. Read Part Two with an eye open for best practices you recognize from the models you have already tried. Identifying familiar material gives you a feel for what is new and what has been carried over from the model you already know.

Next, review the glossary to understand how some terminology may differ from that used in the process improvement model you know. Many concepts will be repeated, but they may be called something different.
[Readers Familiar with CMMI]()

If you have reviewed or used a CMMI model before, you will quickly recognize the CMMI concepts discussed and the best practices presented. The differences between version 1.2 and version 1.1 are explained in detail on the SEI Web site in the version 1.2 release notes. These differences reflect the enhancements suggested by the users of version 1.1.

The following improvements were made to version 1.2:

·         Both representations are presented together.

·         The advanced practice and common feature concepts have been removed.

·         The generic goal and practice descriptions were moved to Part Two.

·         Hardware amplifications were added.

·         All definitions were consolidated in the glossary.

·         IPPD practices were consolidated and simplified. There are no longer any separate IPPD process areas.

·         Supplier Agreement Management (SAM) and Integrated Supplier Management (ISM) were consolidated and Supplier Sourcing was removed.

·         Generic practice (GP) elaborations were added to the level 3 GPs.

·         An explanation of how process areas support the implementation of GPs was added.

·         Material was added to ensure that standard processes are deployed to projects at their startup.

# []()[]()[]()[]()[]()1     Introduction

Now, more than ever, companies want to deliver products and services better, faster, and cheaper. At the same time, in the high-technology environment of the twenty-first century, nearly all organizations have found themselves building increasingly complex products and services. Today, a single company usually does not develop all the components that compose a product or service. More commonly, some components are built in-house and some are acquired; then all the components are integrated into the final product or service. Organizations must be able to manage and control this complex development and maintenance process.

The problems these organizations address today involve enterprise-wide solutions that require an integrated approach. Effective management of organizational assets is critical to business success. In essence, these organizations are product and service developers that need a way to manage an integrated approach to their development activities as part of achieving their business objectives.

In the current marketplace, there are maturity models, standards, methodologies, and guidelines that can help an organization improve the way it does business. However, most available improvement approaches focus on a specific part of the business and do not take a systemic approach to the problems that most organizations are facing. By focusing on improving one area of a business, these models have unfortunately perpetuated the stovepipes and barriers that exist in organizations.

Capability Maturity Model® Integration (CMMI®) provides an opportunity to avoid or eliminate these stovepipes and barriers through integrated models that transcend disciplines. CMMI for Development consists of best practices that address development and maintenance activities applied to products and services. It addresses practices that cover the product’s lifecycle from conception through delivery and maintenance. The emphasis is on the work necessary to build and maintain the total product.
[About Capability Maturity Models]()

In its research to help organizations develop and maintain quality products and services, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) has found several dimensions that an organization can focus on to improve its business. Figure 1.1 illustrates the three critical dimensions that organizations typically focus on: people, procedures and methods, and tools and equipment.

 

![]()

Figure 1.1: The Three Critical Dimensions

But what holds everything together? It is the processes used in your organization. Processes allow you to align the way you do business. They allow you to address scalability and provide a way to incorporate knowledge of how to do things better. Processes allow you to leverage your resources and to examine business trends.

This is not to say that people and technology are not important. We are living in a world where technology is changing by an order of magnitude every ten years. Similarly, people typically work for many companies throughout their careers. We live in a dynamic world. A focus on process provides the infrastructure necessary to deal with an ever-changing world, and to maximize the productivity of people and the use of technology to be more competitive.

Manufacturing has long recognized the importance of process effectiveness and efficiency. Today, many organizations in manufacturing and service industries recognize the importance of quality processes. Process helps an organization’s workforce meet business objectives by helping them work smarter, not harder, and with improved consistency. Effective processes also provide a vehicle for introducing and using new technology in a way that best meets the business objectives of the organization.

In the 1930s, Walter Shewhart began work in process improvement with his principles of statistical quality control [Shewhart 1931]. These principles were refined by W. Edwards Deming [Deming 1986], Phillip Crosby [Crosby 1979], and Joseph Juran [Juran 1988]. Watts Humphrey, Ron Radice, and others extended these principles even further and began applying them to software in their work at IBM and the SEI [Humphrey 1989]. Humphrey’s book, Managing the Software Process, provides a description of the basic principles and concepts on which many of the capability maturity models (CMMs®) are based.

The SEI has taken the process management premise, “the quality of a system or product is highly influenced by the quality of the process used to develop and maintain it,” and defined CMMs that embody this premise. The belief in this premise is seen worldwide in quality movements, as evidenced by the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) body of standards.

CMMs focus on improving processes in an organization. They contain the essential elements of effective processes for one or more disciplines and describe an evolutionary improvement path from ad hoc, immature processes to disciplined, mature processes with improved quality and effectiveness.

The SEI created the first CMM designed for software organizations and published it in a book, The Capability Maturity Model: Guidelines for Improving the Software Process [SEI 1995].

The SEI’s book applied the principles introduced almost a century ago to this never-ending cycle of process improvement. The value of this process improvement approach has been confirmed over time. Organizations have experienced increased productivity and quality, improved cycle time, and more accurate and predictable schedules and budgets [Gibson 2006].
[Evolution of CMMI]()

Since 1991, CMMs have been developed for myriad disciplines. Some of the most notable include models for systems engineering, software engineering, software acquisition, workforce management and development, and integrated product and process development (IPPD).

Although these models have proven useful to many organizations in different industries, the use of multiple models has been problematic. Many organizations would like their improvement efforts to span different groups in their organizations. However, the differences among the discipline-specific models used by each group, including their architecture, content, and approach, have limited these organizations’ capabilities to broaden their improvements successfully. Further, applying multiple models that are not integrated within and across an organization is costly in terms of training, appraisals, and improvement activities.

The CMM IntegrationSM project was formed to sort out the problem of using multiple CMMs. The CMMI Product Team’s initial mission was to combine three source models:

1.    TheCapability Maturity Model for Software (SW-CMM) v2.0 draft C [SEI 1997b]

2.    TheSystems Engineering Capability Model (SECM) [EIA 1998][[5]]()

3.    TheIntegrated Product Development Capability Maturity Model (IPD-CMM) v0.98 [SEI 1997a]

 

The combination of these models into a single improvement framework was intended for use by organizations in their pursuit of enterprise-wide process improvement.

These three source models were selected because of their widespread adoption in the software and systems engineering communities and because of their different approaches to improving processes in an organization.

Using information from these popular and well-regarded models as source material, the CMMI Product Team created a cohesive set of integrated models that can be adopted by those currently using the source models, as well as by those new to the CMM concept. Hence, CMMI is a result of the evolution of the SW-CMM, the SECM, and the IPD-CMM.

Developing a set of integrated models involved more than simply combining existing model materials. Using processes that promote consensus, the CMMI Product Team built a framework that accommodates multiple disciplines and is flexible enough to support the different approaches of the source models [Ahern 2003].

![]()

Figure 1.2: The History of CMMs

Since the release of CMMI v1.1, we have seen that this improvement framework can be applied to other areas of interest [SEI 2002a, SEI 2002b]. To apply to multiple areas of interest, the framework groups best practices into what we call “constellations.” A constellation is a collection of CMMI components that are used to build models, training materials, and appraisal documents.

Recently, the CMMI model architecture was improved to support multiple constellations and the sharing of best practices among constellations and their member models. Work has begun on two new constellations: one for services (CMMI for Services) and the other for acquisition (CMMI for Acquisition). Although CMMI for Development incorporates the development of services, including the combination of components, consumables, and people intended to meet service requirements, it differs from the planned CMMI for Services (CMMI-SVC), which focuses on the delivery of services. The CMMI models that have been available in the community prior to 2006 are now considered part of the CMMI for Development constellation.
[CMMI for Development]()

The CMMI for Development constellation consists of two models: CMMI for Development +IPPD and CMMI for Development (without IPPD). Both models share much of their material and are identical in these shared areas. However, CMMI for Development +IPPD contains additional goals and practices that cover IPPD.

Currently, only one model is published since the CMMI for Development +IPPD model contains the full complement of practices available in this constellation, and you can derive the other model from this material. If you are not using IPPD, ignore the information that is marked “IPPD Addition,” and you will be using the CMMI for Development model. If the need arises or the development constellation is expanded, the architecture will allow other models to be generated and published.

CMMI for Development is the designated successor of the three source models. The SEI has retired the Software CMM and the IPD-CMM. EIA has retired the SECM. All three of these models are succeeded by CMMI for Development.

The best practices in the CMMI models have gone through an extensive review process. CMMI version 0.2 was publicly reviewed and used in pilot activities.

The CMMI Product Team evaluated more than 3,000 change requests to create CMMI version 1.0. Shortly thereafter, version 1.02 was released, which incorporated several minor improvements.

Version 1.1 incorporated improvements guided by feedback from early use, with more than 1,500 change requests submitted as part of the public review, and hundreds of comments as part of the change control process.

CMMI version 1.2 was developed using input from nearly 2,000 change requests submitted by CMMI users. More than 750 of those requests were directed at CMMI model content. As you can see, not only is CMMI widely adopted, but it is improved based on the feedback received from the community.
[The Scope of CMMI for Development]()

CMMI for Development is a reference model that covers the development and maintenance activities applied to both products and services. Organizations from many industries, including aerospace, banking, computer hardware, software, defense, automobile manufacturing, and telecommunications, use CMMI for Development.

Models in the CMMI for Development constellation contain practices that cover project management, process management, systems engineering, hardware engineering, software engineering, and other supporting processes used in development and maintenance. The CMMI for Development +IPPD model also covers the use of integrated teams for development and maintenance activities.
[The Group of IPPD Additions]()

In CMMI, “additions” are used to include material that may be of interest to particular users. For the CMMI for Development constellation, additional material was included to address IPPD.

The IPPD group of additions covers an IPPD approach that includes practices that help organizations achieve the timely collaboration of relevant stakeholders throughout the life of the product to satisfy customers’ needs, expectations, and requirements [DoD 1996]. When using processes that support an IPPD approach, you should integrate these processes with other processes in the organization. To support those using IPPD-related processes, the CMMI for Development constellation allows organizations to optionally select the IPPD group of additions.

When you select CMMI for Development +IPPD, you are selecting the CMMI for Development model plus all the IPPD additions. When you select CMMI for Development, you are selecting the model without the IPPD additions. In the text in Part One of this document, we may use “CMMI for Development” to refer to either of these models, for the sake of brevity.
[Resolving Different Approaches of CMMs]()

The definition of a CMM allows the community to develop models supporting different approaches to process improvement. As long as a model contains the essential elements of effective processes for one or more disciplines and describes an evolutionary improvement path from ad hoc, immature processes to disciplined, mature processes with improved quality and effectiveness, it is considered a CMM. CMMI enables you to approach process improvement and appraisals using two different representations: continuous and staged.

The continuous representation enables an organization to select a process area (or group of process areas) and improve processes related to it. This representation uses capability levels to characterize improvement relative to an individual process area.

The staged representation uses predefined sets of process areas to define an improvement path for an organization. This improvement path is characterized by maturity levels. Each maturity level provides a set of process areas that characterize different organizational behaviors.
[Choosing a Representation]()

If you are new to process improvement and are not familiar with either the staged or the continuous representation, you cannot go wrong if you choose one representation or the other. There are many valid reasons to select either representation.

If you have been using a CMM and you are familiar with a particular representation, we suggest that you continue to use that representation because it will make the transition to CMMI easier. Once you have become completely comfortable with CMMI, you might then decide to use the other representation.

Because each representation has advantages over the other, some organizations use both representations to address particular needs at various times in their improvement programs. In the following sections, we provide the advantages and disadvantages of each representation to help you decide which representation is best for your organization.
[Continuous Representation]()

The continuous representation offers maximum flexibility when using a CMMI model for process improvement. An organization may choose to improve the performance of a single process-related trouble spot, or it can work on several areas that are closely aligned to the organization’s business objectives. The continuous representation also allows an organization to improve different processes at different rates. There are some limitations on an organization’s choices because of the dependencies among some process areas.

If you know the processes that need to be improved in your organization and you understand the dependencies among the process areas described in CMMI, the continuous representation is a good choice for your organization.
[Staged Representation]()

The staged representation offers a systematic, structured way to approach model-based process improvement one stage at a time. Achieving each stage ensures that an adequate process infrastructure has been laid as a foundation for the next stage.

Process areas are organized by maturity levels that take some of the guess work out of process improvement. The staged representation prescribes an order for implementing process areas according to maturity levels, which define the improvement path for an organization from the initial level to the optimizing level. Achieving each maturity level ensures that an adequate improvement foundation has been laid for the next maturity level and allows for lasting, incremental improvement.

If you do not know where to start and which processes to choose to improve, the staged representation is a good choice for you. It gives you a specific set of processes to improve at each stage that has been determined through more than a decade of research and experience with process improvement.
[Comparison of the Continuous and Staged Representations]()

Table 1.1 compares the advantages of each representation and may assist you with determining which representation is right for your organization.

 

Table 1.1 Comparative Advantages of Continuous and Staged Representations
Continuous Representation
 
Staged Representation Grants explicit freedom to select the order of improvement that best meets the organization’s business objectives and mitigates the organization’s areas of risk
 
Enables organizations to have a predefined and proven improvement path Enables increased visibility of the capability achieved in each individual process area
 
Focuses on a set of processes that provide an organization with a specific capability that is characterized by each maturity level Allows improvements of different processes to be performed at different rates
 
Summarizes process improvement results in a simple form—a single maturity level number Reflects a newer approach that does not yet have the data to demonstrate its ties to return on investment
 
Builds on a relatively long history of use that includes case studies and data that demonstrate return on investment

 

[Factors in Your Decision]()

Three categories of factors that may influence your decision when selecting a representation are business, culture, and legacy.

Business Factors

An organization with mature knowledge of its own business objectives is likely to have a strong mapping of its processes to its business objectives. Such an organization may find the continuous representation useful to appraise its processes and in determining how well the organization’s processes support and meet its business objectives.

If an organization with a product-line focus decides to improve processes across the entire organization, it might be served best by the staged representation. The staged representation will help an organization select the critical processes to focus on for improvement.

The same organization may opt to improve processes by product line. In that case, it might select the continuous representation—and a different appraised rating of capability might be achieved for each product line. Both approaches are valid. The most important consideration is which business objectives you would like your process improvement program to support and how these business objectives align with the two representations.
Cultural Factors

Cultural factors to consider when selecting a representation have to do with an organization’s capability to deploy a process improvement program. For instance, an organization might select the continuous representation if the corporate culture is process based and experienced in process improvement or has a specific process that needs to be improved quickly. An organization that has little experience in process improvement may choose the staged representation, which provides additional guidance on the order in which changes should occur.

Legacy

If an organization has experience with another model that has a staged representation, it may be wise to continue with the staged representation when using CMMI, especially if it has invested resources and deployed processes across the organization that are associated with a staged representation. The same is true for the continuous representation.

[Why Not Both Representations?]()

Whether used for process improvement or appraisals, both representations are designed to offer essentially equivalent results. Nearly all of the CMMI model content is common to both representations. Therefore, an organization need not select one representation over another.

In fact, an organization may find utility in both representations. It is rare that an organization will implement either representation exactly as prescribed. Organizations that are successful in process improvement often define an improvement plan that focuses on the unique needs of that organization and therefore use the principles of both the staged and the continuous representations.

For example, organizations that select the staged representation and are at maturity level 1 often implement the maturity level 2 process areas but also the Organizational Process Focus process area, which is included at maturity level 3. Another example is an organization that chooses the continuous representation for guiding its internal process improvement effort and then chooses the staged representation to conduct an appraisal.
[Your Approach to Process Improvement]()

To demonstrate how to use this model, let us look at two different scenarios. Scenario 1 is an electronic systems developer that wants to improve its product development processes using a continuous approach. Scenario 2 is a software development company that uses IPPD, has been using the Software CMM, and now wants to use CMMI. This company most recently has been rated at maturity level 3 using the Software CMM (version 1.1).

[Scenario 1]()

In this scenario, you are using a continuous approach and, therefore, you select the processes that are important to your business objectives. Since there are 22 process areas to choose from, this is usually too many to focus on when starting out. You may need to narrow your focus. For example, you may find that your competitor always releases its product before yours. You may choose to focus on improving your engineering and project management processes.

Building on this decision, you select all the Engineering process areas as a starting point: Product Integration, Requirements Development, Requirements Management, Technical Solution, Validation, and Verification. You also select Project Planning and Project Monitoring and Control.

You may at this point decide that eight process areas are still too many to focus on initially, and you decide that the requirements process is really where the problems are. Consequently, you select the Requirements Development and Requirements Management process areas to begin your improvement efforts.

Next you decide how much improvement is needed in the requirements area. Do you have any processes in place already? If you do not, your process improvement objective may be to get to capability level 1.

Do you have your requirements development and management processes in place for each project, but they are not managed processes? For example, policies, training, and tools are not implemented to support the processes. If your requirements processes are in place but there is no supporting infrastructure, your process improvement objective may be to get to capability level 2.

Do you have all your requirements development and management processes and their management in place, but each project performs these processes differently? For example, your requirements elicitation process is not performed consistently across the organization. If this is the case, your process improvement objective may be to get to capability level 3.

Do you consistently manage and perform your requirements development and management processes but do not have an objective way to control and improve these processes? If this is the case, your process improvement objective may be to get to capability level 4.

Do you want to ensure that you are selecting the right subprocesses to improve based on quantitative objectives to maximize your business? If so, your process improvement objective may be to get to capability level 5 for selected processes. In the description of each process area, remember to look for amplifications introduced by the phrases “For Hardware Engineering,” “For Systems Engineering,” and “For Software Engineering.” Use all information that has no specific markings and the material in the boxes labeled “Continuous Only.”

As you can see from this scenario, you need to understand which processes need improvement and how much you want to mature each process. This way of proceeding reflects the fundamental principle behind the continuous representation.
[Scenario 2]()

In the second scenario, you are a software development company using IPPD, using the Software CMM, and you want to use CMMI. You select the process areas at maturity levels 2 and 3 and choose the CMMI for Development +IPPD model.

This selection includes the following seven process areas at maturity level 2: Requirements Management, Project Planning, Project Monitoring and Control, Supplier Agreement Management, Measurement and Analysis, Process and Product Quality Assurance, and Configuration Management. It also includes the following 11 process areas at maturity level 3: Requirements Development, Technical Solution, Product Integration, Verification, Validation, Organizational Process Focus, Organizational Process Definition +IPPD, Organizational Training, Integrated Project Management +IPPD, Risk Management, and Decision Analysis and Resolution. You will also include the IPPD additions.

Since you have already been rated at maturity level 3 for the Software CMM, look at the CMMI process areas that were not in the Software CMM. These process areas include Measurement and Analysis, Requirements Development, Technical Solution, Product Integration, Verification, Validation, Risk Management, and Decision Analysis and Resolution. Determine if you have these processes in your organization even though they were not described in the Software CMM. If any processes in place correspond to these process areas and the other process areas that were in the Software CMM, perform a gap analysis against the goals and practices to make sure you addressed the intent of each CMMI process area.

Remember, in each process area you select, to look for information labeled “For Software Engineering” and “IPPD Addition.” Use all information that has no specific markings, as well as the material in boxes labeled “Staged Only.”

As you can see, the information provided in this document can be used in a variety of ways, depending on your improvement needs. The overall goal of CMMI is to provide a framework that can share consistent process improvement best practices and approaches, but can be flexible enough to address the rapidly changing needs of the community.
# []()[]()[]()[]()[]()2     Process Area Components

This chapter describes the components of each process area, generic goal, and generic practice. Understanding the meaning of these components is critical to using the information in Part Two effectively. If you are unfamiliar with Part Two, you may want to skim the Generic Goals and Generic Practices section and a couple of process area sections to get a general feel for the content and layout before reading this chapter.

[Required, Expected, and Informative Components]()

Model components are grouped into three categories—required, expected, and informative—that reflect how to interpret them.

[Required Components]()

Required components describe what an organization must achieve to satisfy a process area. This achievement must be visibly implemented in an organization’s processes. The required components in CMMI are the specific and generic goals. Goal satisfaction is used in appraisals as the basis for deciding whether a process area has been achieved and satisfied.

[Expected Components]()

Expected components describe what an organization may implement to achieve a required component. Expected components guide those who implement improvements or perform appraisals. Expected components include the specific and generic practices.

Before goals can be considered satisfied, either the practices as described, or acceptable alternatives to them, are present in the planned and implemented processes of the organization.
[Informative Components]()

Informative components provide details that help organizations get started in thinking about how to approach the required and expected components. Subpractices, typical work products, amplifications, generic practice elaborations, goal and practice titles, goal and practice notes, and references are examples of informative model components.

The CMMI glossary of terms is not a required, expected, or informative component of CMMI models. You should interpret the terms in the glossary in the context of the model component in which they appear.
[Components Associated with Part Two]()

The model components associated with Part Two can be summarized to illustrate their relationships, as shown in Figure 2.1.

![]()

Figure 2.1: CMMI Model Components

The following sections provide detailed descriptions of the model components.
****

[Process Areas]()

A process area is a cluster of related practices in an area that, when implemented collectively, satisfy a set of goals considered important for making improvement in that area.

There are 22 process areas, presented here in alphabetical order by acronym:

·         Causal Analysis and Resolution (CAR)

·         Configuration Management (CM)

·         Decision Analysis and Resolution (DAR)

·         Integrated Project Management +IPPD (IPM+IPPD)[[6]]()

·         Measurement and Analysis (MA)

·         Organizational Innovation and Deployment (OID)

·         Organizational Process Definition +IPPD (OPD+IPPD)6

·         Organizational Process Focus (OPF)

·         Organizational Process Performance (OPP)

·         Organizational Training (OT)

·         Product Integration (PI)

·         Project Monitoring and Control (PMC)

·         Project Planning (PP)

·         Process and Product Quality Assurance (PPQA)

·         Quantitative Project Management (QPM)

·         Requirements Development (RD)

·         Requirements Management (REQM)

·         Risk Management (RSKM)

·         Supplier Agreement Management (SAM)

·         Technical Solution (TS)

·         Validation (VAL)

·         Verification (VER)
****

[Purpose Statements]()

The purpose statement describes the purpose of the process area and is an informative component.

For example, the purpose statement of the Organizational Process Definition process area is “The purpose of Organizational Process Definition (OPD) is to establish and maintain a usable set of organizational process assets and work environment standards.”
[Introductory Notes]()

The introductory notes section of the process area describes the major concepts covered in the process area and is an informative component.

An example from the introductory notes of the Project Planning process area is “Planning begins with requirements that define the product and project.”
[Related Process Areas]()

The related process areas section lists references to related process areas and reflects the high-level relationships among the process areas. The related process area section is an informative component.

An example of a reference found in the related process areas section of the Project Planning process area is “Refer to the Risk Management process area for more information about identifying and managing risks.”
[Specific Goals]()

A specific goal describes the unique characteristics that must be present to satisfy the process area. A specific goal is a required model component and is used in appraisals to help determine whether a process area is satisfied.

For example, a specific goal from the Configuration Management process area is “Integrity of baselines is established and maintained.”

Only the statement of the specific goal is a required model component. The title of a specific goal (preceded by the goal number) and any notes associated with the goal are considered informative model components.
[Generic Goals]()

Generic goals are called “generic” because the same goal statement applies to multiple process areas. A generic goal describes the characteristics that must be present to institutionalize the processes that implement a process area. A generic goal is a required model component and is used in appraisals to determine whether a process area is satisfied. (See the Generic Goals and Generic Practices section on page 75 for a more detailed description of generic goals.)

An example of a generic goal is “The process is institutionalized as a defined process.”

Only the statement of the generic goal is a required model component. The title of a generic goal (preceded by the goal number) and any notes associated with the goal are considered informative model components.
[Specific Goal and Practice Summaries]()

The specific goal and practice summary provides a high-level summary of the specific goals, which are required components, and the specific practices, which are expected components. The specific goal and practice summary is an informative component.

[Specific Practices]()

A specific practice is the description of an activity that is considered important in achieving the associated specific goal. The specific practices describe the activities that are expected to result in achievement of the specific goals of a process area. A specific practice is an expected model component.

For example, a specific practice from the Project Monitoring and Control process area is “Monitor commitments against those identified in the project plan.”

Only the statement of the specific practice is an expected model component. The title of a specific practice (preceded by the practice number) and any notes associated with the specific practice are considered informative model components.
[Typical Work Products]()

The typical work products section lists sample output from a specific practice. These examples are called typical work products because there are often other work products that are just as effective but are not listed. A typical work product is an informative model component.

For example, a typical work product for the specific practice “Monitor the actual values of the project planning parameters against the project” in the Project Monitoring and Control process area is “Records of significant deviations.”
[Subpractices]()

A subpractice is a detailed description that provides guidance for interpreting and implementing a specific or generic practice. Subpractices may be worded as if prescriptive, but are actually an informative component meant only to provide ideas that may be useful for process improvement.

For example, a subpractice for the specific practice “Take corrective action on identified issues” in the Project Monitoring and Control process area is “Determine and document the appropriate actions needed to address the identified issues.”
[Generic Practices]()

Generic practices are called “generic” because the same practice applies to multiple process areas. A generic practice is the description of an activity that is considered important in achieving the associated generic goal. A generic practice is an expected model component.

For example, a generic practice for the generic goal “The process is institutionalized as a managed process” is “Provide adequate resources for performing the process, developing the work products, and providing the services of the process.”

Only the statement of the generic practice is an expected model component. The title of a generic practice (preceded by the practice number) and any notes associated with the practice are considered informative model components.

To reduce the repetitiveness of this information and to conserve the number of pages required to present this information, only the generic practice title, statement, and elaborations appear in the process areas. (See the Generic Goals and Generic Practices section on page 75 for a complete description of the generic practices.)
[Generic Practice Elaborations]()

A generic practice elaboration appears after a generic practice in a process area to provide guidance on how the generic practice should be applied uniquely to the process area. A generic practice elaboration is an informative model component.

For example, a generic practice elaboration after the generic practice “Establish and maintain an organizational policy for planning and performing the project planning process” in the Project Planning process area is “This policy establishes organizational expectations for estimating the planning parameters, making internal and external commitments, and developing the plan for managing the project.”
[Supporting Informative Components]()

In many places, further information is needed to describe a concept. This informative material is provided in the form of the following components:

·         Notes

·         Examples

·         Amplifications

·         References
[Notes]()

A note is text that can accompany nearly any other model component. It may provide detail, background, or rationale. A note is an informative model component.

For example, a note that accompanies the specific practice “Implement the selected action proposals that were developed in causal analysis” in the Causal Analysis and Resolution process area is “Only changes that prove to be of value should be considered for broad implementation.”
[Examples]()

An example is a component comprising text and often a list of items, usually in a box, that can accompany nearly any other component and provides one or more examples to clarify a concept or described activity. An example is an informative model component.

The following is an example that accompanies the subpractice “Document noncompliance issues when they cannot be resolved within the project” under the specific practice “Communicate quality issues and ensure resolution of noncompliance issues with the staff and managers” in the Process and Product Quality Assurance process area.
Examples of ways to resolve noncompliance within the project include the following:

·         Fixing the noncompliance

·         Changing the process descriptions, standards, or procedures that were violated

·         Obtaining a waiver to cover the noncompliance issue

[Amplifications]()

An amplification is a note or example that is relevant to a particular discipline. The disciplines covered in this model are hardware engineering, systems engineering, and software engineering.

Each amplification is labeled with a heading that indicates the discipline to which it applies. For example, an amplification for software engineering is labeled “For Software Engineering.” An amplification is an informative model component.

An example of an amplification is the one that accompanies the specific practice “Establish and maintain the overall project plan content” in the Project Planning process area. The amplification states “For Hardware Engineering: For hardware, the planning document is often referred to as a hardware development plan. Development activities in preparation for production may be included in the hardware development plan or defined in a separate production plan.”
[References]()

A reference is a pointer to additional or more detailed information in related process areas and can accompany nearly any other model component. A reference is an informative model component.

For example, a reference that accompanies the specific practice “Select the subprocesses that compose the project's defined process based on historical stability and capability data” in the Quantitative Project Management process area is “Refer to the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about the organization's process asset library, which might include a process element of known and needed capability.”
[Numbering Scheme]()

Specific and generic goals are numbered sequentially. Each specific goal begins with the prefix SG (e.g., SG 1). Each generic goal begins with the prefix GG (e.g., GG 2).

Each specific practice begins with the prefix SP, followed by a number in the form x.y (e.g., SP 1.1). The x is the same number as the goal to which the specific practice maps. The y is the sequence number of the specific practice under the specific goal.

An example of specific practice numbering is in the Project Planning process area. The first specific practice is numbered SP 1.1 and the second is SP 1.2.

Each generic practice begins with the prefix GP, followed by a number in the form x.y (e.g., GP 1.1).

The x corresponds to the number of the generic goal. The y is the sequence number of the generic practice under the generic goal. For example, the first generic practice associated with GG 2 is numbered GP 2.1 and the second is GP 2.2.
[Typographical Conventions]()

The typographical conventions used in this model were designed to enable you to select what you need and use it effectively. We present model components in formats that allow you to find them quickly on the page.

Figures 2.2 through 2.4 are sample pages from process areas in Part Two; they show the different process area components, labeled so that you can identify them. Notice that components differ typographically so that you can easily identify each one.

[Representation-Specific Content]()

In Part Two, you will notice that some components in the Generic Practices by Goal section of each process area are in a box and labeled “Staged Only,” “Continuous Only,” or “Continuous/Maturity Levels 3–5.”

Components that are not marked apply to both representations. Components marked “Staged Only” apply only if you are using the staged representation. Components marked “Continuous Only” apply only if you are using the continuous representation. (See Figure 2.4 for an example.)

Components marked “Continuous/Maturity Levels 3–5” apply if you are using the continuous representation or if you are using the staged representation and are pursuing maturity level 3, 4, or 5. However, these components do not apply if you are pursuing a maturity level 2 rating using the staged representation.
[Additions]()

An addition can be informative material, a specific practice, a specific goal, or a process area that extends the scope of a model or emphasizes a particular aspect of its use. In this document, all additions apply to IPPD.

An example of an addition is the one from the Organizational Training process area that appears after specific goal 1, “Establish an Organizational Training Capability.” The addition states “Cross-functional training, leadership training, interpersonal skills training, and training in the skills needed to integrate appropriate business and technical functions is needed by integrated team members. The potentially wider range of requirements and participant backgrounds may require relevant stakeholders who were not involved in requirements development to take cross training in the disciplines involved in product design in order to commit to requirements with a full understanding of the range of requirements and their interrelationships.”
# []()[]()[]()[]()[]()[]()3     Tying It All Together

Now that you have been introduced to the components of CMMI models, you need to understand how they all fit together to meet your process improvement needs [Dymond 2004]. In this chapter, we introduce the concept of levels and show how the process areas are organized and used. To do this, we need to revisit the discussion that began in Chapter 1.

[Understanding Levels]()

Levels are used in CMMI to describe an evolutionary path recommended for an organization that wants to improve the processes it uses to develop and maintain its products and services. Levels can also be the outcome of the rating activity of appraisals.[[7]]() Appraisals can be performed for organizations that comprise entire (usually small) companies, or for smaller groups such as a group of projects or a division within a company.

CMMI supports two improvement paths. One path enables organizations to incrementally improve processes corresponding to an individual process area (or process areas) selected by the organization. The other path enables organizations to improve a set of related processes by incrementally addressing successive sets of process areas.

These two improvement paths are associated with the two types of levels that correspond to the two representations discussed in Chapter 1. For the continuous representation, we use the term “capability level.” For the staged representation, we use the term “maturity level.”

Regardless of which representation you select, the concept of levels is the same. Levels characterize improvement from an ill-defined state to a state that uses quantitative information to determine and manage improvements that are needed to meet an organization’s business objectives.

To reach a particular level, an organization must satisfy all of the appropriate goals of the process area or set of process areas that are targeted for improvement, regardless of whether it is a capability or a maturity level.

Both representations also provide ways to implement process improvement to achieve business objectives. Both representations provide the same essential content and use the same model components.
[Structures of the Continuous and Staged Representations]()

Figure 3.1 illustrates the structures of the continuous and staged representations. The differences jump out at you immediately when you look at the structure of both representations. The staged representation utilizes maturity levels, whereas the continuous representation utilizes capability levels.

![]()

Figure 3.1: Structure of the Continuous and Staged Representations 

 

What may strike you as you compare these two representations is their similarity. Both have many of the same components (e.g., process areas, specific goals, and specific practices), and these components have the same hierarchy and configuration.

What is not readily apparent from the high-level view in Figure 3.1 is that the continuous representation focuses on process area capability as measured by capability levels and the staged representation focuses on organizational maturity as measured by maturity levels. These dimensions (the capability/maturity dimensions) of CMMI are used for benchmarking and appraisal activities, as well as guiding an organization’s improvement efforts.

·         Capability levels, which belong to a continuous representation, apply to an organization’s process improvement achievement in individual process areas. These levels are a means for incrementally improving the processes corresponding to a given process area. There are six capability levels, numbered 0 through 5.

·         Maturity levels, which belong to a staged representation, apply to an organization’s process improvement achievement across multiple process areas. These levels are a means of predicting the general outcomes of the next project undertaken. There are five maturity levels, numbered 1 through 5.

Table 3.1 compares the six capability levels to the five maturity levels. Notice that the names of four of the levels are the same in both representations. The differences are that there is no maturity level 0 for the staged representation, and at level 1, the capability level is Performed, whereas the maturity level is Initial. Therefore, the starting point is different for the two representations.

The continuous representation is concerned with selecting both a particular process area to improve and the desired capability level for that process area. In this context, whether a process is performed or incomplete is important. Therefore, the name “incomplete” is given to the continuous representation starting point.

Because the staged representation is concerned with the overall maturity of the organization, whether individual processes are performed or incomplete is not the primary focus. Therefore, the name “initial” is given to the staged representation starting point.

Both capability levels and maturity levels provide a way to measure how well organizations can and do improve their processes. However, the associated approach to process improvement is different.
[Understanding Capability Levels]()

To support those using the continuous representation, all CMMI models reflect capability levels in their design and content. A capability level consists of a generic goal and its related generic practices as they relate to a process area, which can improve the organization’s processes associated with that process area. As you satisfy the generic goal and its generic practices at each capability level, you reap the benefits of process improvement for that process area.

The six capability levels, designated by the numbers 0 through 5, are as follows:

0.    Incomplete

1.    Performed

2.    Managed

3.    Defined

4.    Quantitatively Managed

5.    Optimizing

 

The fact that capability levels 2 through 5 use the same terms as generic goals 2 through 5 is intentional because each of these generic goals and practices reflects the meaning of the capability levels in terms of goals and practices you can implement. (See the Generic Goals and Generic Practices section on page 75 for more information about generic goals and practices.) A short description of each capability level follows.
[Capability Level 0: Incomplete]()

An “incomplete process” is a process that either is not performed or partially performed. One or more of the specific goals of the process area are not satisfied, and no generic goals exist for this level since there is no reason to institutionalize a partially performed process.

[Capability Level 1: Performed]()

A capability level 1 process is characterized as a “performed process.” A performed process is a process that satisfies the specific goals of the process area. It supports and enables the work needed to produce work products.

Although capability level 1 results in important improvements, those improvements can be lost over time if they are not institutionalized. The application of institutionalization (the CMMI generic practices at capability levels 2 through 5) helps to ensure that improvements are maintained.
[Capability Level 2: Managed]()

A capability level 2 process is characterized as a “managed process.” A managed process is a performed (capability level 1) process that has the basic infrastructure in place to support the process. It is planned and executed in accordance with policy; employs skilled people who have adequate resources to produce controlled outputs; involves relevant stakeholders; is monitored, controlled, and reviewed; and is evaluated for adherence to its process description. The process discipline reflected by capability level 2 helps to ensure that existing practices are retained during times of stress.

[Capability Level 3: Defined]()

A capability level 3 process is characterized as a “defined process.” A defined process is a managed (capability level 2) process that is tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes according to the organization’s tailoring guidelines, and contributes work products, measures, and other process improvement information to the organizational process assets.

A critical distinction between capability levels 2 and 3 is the scope of standards, process descriptions, and procedures. At capability level 2, the standards, process descriptions, and procedures may be quite different in each specific instance of the process (e.g., on a particular project). At capability level 3, the standards, process descriptions, and procedures for a project are tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes to suit a particular project or organizational unit and therefore are more consistent, except for the differences allowed by the tailoring guidelines.

Another critical distinction is that at capability level 3, processes are typically described more rigorously than at capability level 2. A defined process clearly states the purpose, inputs, entry criteria, activities, roles, measures, verification steps, outputs, and exit criteria. At capability level 3, processes are managed more proactively using an understanding of the interrelationships of the process activities and detailed measures of the process, its work products, and its services.
[Capability Level 4: Quantitatively Managed]()

A capability level 4 process is characterized as a “quantitatively managed process.” A quantitatively managed process is a defined (capability level 3) process that is controlled using statistical and other quantitative techniques. Quantitative objectives for quality and process performance are established and used as criteria in managing the process. Quality and process performance is understood in statistical terms and is managed throughout the life of the process.

[Capability Level 5: Optimizing]()

A capability level 5 process is characterized as an “optimizing process.” An optimizing process is a quantitatively managed (capability level 4) process that is improved based on an understanding of the common causes of variation inherent in the process. The focus of an optimizing process is on continually improving the range of process performance through both incremental and innovative improvements.

Remember that capability levels 2 through 5 use the same terms as generic goals 2 through 5, and a detailed description of these terms appears in the Generic Goals and Generic Practices section on page 75.
[Advancing through Capability Levels]()

The capability levels of a process area are achieved through the application of generic practices or suitable alternatives to the processes associated with that process area.

Reaching capability level 1 for a process area is equivalent to saying that the processes associated with that process area are “performed processes.”

Reaching capability level 2 for a process area is equivalent to saying that there is a policy that indicates you will perform the process. There is a plan for performing it, resources are provided, responsibilities are assigned, training to perform it is provided, selected work products related to performing the process are controlled, and so on. In other words, a capability level 2 process can be planned and monitored just like any project or support activity.

Reaching capability level 3 for a process area assumes that an organizational standard process exists associated with that process area, which can be tailored to the needs of the project. The processes in the organization are now more consistently defined and applied because they are based on organizational standard processes.

Reaching capability level 4 for a process area assumes that this process area is a key business driver that the organization wants to manage using quantitative and statistical techniques. This analysis gives the organization more visibility into the performance of selected subprocesses that will make it more competitive in the marketplace.

Reaching capability level 5 for a process area assumes that you have stabilized the selected subprocesses and that you want to reduce the common causes of variation within that process. Remember that variation is a natural occurrence in any process, so although it is conceptually feasible to improve all processes, it would not be economical to improve all processes to level 5. Again, you would concentrate on those processes that would help you to meet your business objectives.
[Understanding Maturity Levels]()

To support those using the staged representation, all CMMI models reflect maturity levels in their design and content. A maturity level consists of related specific and generic practices for a predefined set of process areas that improve the organization’s overall performance. The maturity level of an organization provides a way to predict an organization’s performance in a given discipline or set of disciplines. Experience has shown that organizations do their best when they focus their process improvement efforts on a manageable number of process areas at a time and that those areas require increasing sophistication as the organization improves.

A maturity level is a defined evolutionary plateau for organizational process improvement. Each maturity level matures an important subset of the organization’s processes, preparing it to move to the next maturity level. The maturity levels are measured by the achievement of the specific and generic goals associated with each predefined set of process areas.

There are five maturity levels, each a layer in the foundation for ongoing process improvement, designated by the numbers 1 through 5:

1.    Initial

2.    Managed

3.    Defined

4.    Quantitatively Managed

5.    Optimizing

 

Remember that maturity levels 2 through 5 use the same terms as capability levels 2 through 5. This was intentional because the concepts of maturity levels and capability levels are complementary. Maturity levels are used to characterize organizational improvement relative to a set of process areas, and capability levels characterize organizational improvement relative to an individual process area.
[Maturity Level 1: Initial]()

At maturity level 1, processes are usually ad hoc and chaotic. The organization usually does not provide a stable environment to support the processes. Success in these organizations depends on the competence and heroics of the people in the organization and not on the use of proven processes. In spite of this chaos, maturity level 1 organizations often produce products and services that work; however, they frequently exceed their budgets and do not meet their schedules.

Maturity level 1 organizations are characterized by a tendency to over commit, abandonment of processes in a time of crisis, and an inability to repeat their successes.
[Maturity Level 2: Managed]()

At maturity level 2, the projects of the organization have ensured that processes are planned and executed in accordance with policy; the projects employ skilled people who have adequate resources to produce controlled outputs; involve relevant stakeholders; are monitored, controlled, and reviewed; and are evaluated for adherence to their process descriptions. The process discipline reflected by maturity level 2 helps to ensure that existing practices are retained during times of stress. When these practices are in place, projects are performed and managed according to their documented plans.

At maturity level 2, the status of the work products and the delivery of services are visible to management at defined points (e.g., at major milestones and at the completion of major tasks). Commitments are established among relevant stakeholders and are revised as needed. Work products are appropriately controlled. The work products and services satisfy their specified process descriptions, standards, and procedures.
[Maturity Level 3: Defined]()

At maturity level 3, processes are well characterized and understood, and are described in standards, procedures, tools, and methods. The organization’s set of standard processes, which is the basis for maturity level 3, is established and improved over time. These standard processes are used to establish consistency across the organization. Projects establish their defined processes by tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes according to tailoring guidelines. (See the glossary for a definition of “organization’s set of standard processes.”)

A critical distinction between maturity levels 2 and 3 is the scope of standards, process descriptions, and procedures. At maturity level 2, the standards, process descriptions, and procedures may be quite different in each specific instance of the process (e.g., on a particular project). At maturity level 3, the standards, process descriptions, and procedures for a project are tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes to suit a particular project or organizational unit and therefore are more consistent, except for the differences allowed by the tailoring guidelines.

Another critical distinction is that at maturity level 3, processes are typically described more rigorously than at maturity level 2. A defined process clearly states the purpose, inputs, entry criteria, activities, roles, measures, verification steps, outputs, and exit criteria. At maturity level 3, processes are managed more proactively using an understanding of the interrelationships of the process activities and detailed measures of the process, its work products, and its services.

At maturity level 3, the organization must further mature the maturity level 2 process areas. The generic practices associated with generic goal 3 that were not addressed at maturity level 2 are applied to achieve maturity level 3.
[Maturity Level 4: Quantitatively Managed]()

At maturity level 4, the organization and projects establish quantitative objectives for quality and process performance and use them as criteria in managing processes. Quantitative objectives are based on the needs of the customer, end users, organization, and process implementers. Quality and process performance is understood in statistical terms and is managed throughout the life of the processes [SEI 2001].

For selected subprocesses, detailed measures of process performance are collected and statistically analyzed. Quality and process-performance measures are incorporated into the organization’s measurement repository to support fact-based decision making [McGarry 2000]. Special causes of process variation are identified and, where appropriate, the sources of special causes are corrected to prevent future occurrences. (See the definition of “special cause of process variation” in the glossary.)

A critical distinction between maturity levels 3 and 4 is the predictability of process performance. At maturity level 4, the performance of processes is controlled using statistical and other quantitative techniques, and is quantitatively predictable. At maturity level 3, processes are typically only qualitatively predictable.
[Maturity Level 5: Optimizing]()

At maturity level 5, an organization continually improves its processes based on a quantitative understanding of the common causes of variation inherent in processes. (See the definition of “common cause of process variation” in the glossary.)

Maturity level 5 focuses on continually improving process performance through incremental and innovative process and technological improvements. Quantitative process improvement objectives for the organization are established, continually revised to reflect changing business objectives, and used as criteria in managing process improvement. The effects of deployed process improvements are measured and evaluated against the quantitative process improvement objectives. Both the defined processes and the organization’s set of standard processes are targets of measurable improvement activities.

A critical distinction between maturity levels 4 and 5 is the type of process variation addressed. At maturity level 4, the organization is concerned with addressing special causes of process variation and providing statistical predictability of the results. Although processes may produce predictable results, the results may be insufficient to achieve the established objectives. At maturity level 5, the organization is concerned with addressing common causes of process variation and changing the process (to shift the mean of the process performance or reduce the inherent process variation experienced) to improve process performance and to achieve the established quantitative process improvement objectives.
****

[Advancing through Maturity Levels]()

Organizations can achieve progressive improvements in their organizational maturity by achieving control first at the project level and continuing to the most advanced level—organization-wide continuous process improvement—using both quantitative and qualitative data to make decisions.

Since improved organizational maturity is associated with improvement in the range of expected results that can be achieved by an organization, it is one way of predicting the general outcomes of the organization’s next project. For instance, at maturity level 2, the organization has been elevated from ad hoc to disciplined by establishing sound project management. As your organization achieves the generic and specific goals for the set of process areas in a maturity level, you are increasing your organizational maturity and reaping the benefits of process improvement. Because each maturity level forms a necessary foundation for the next level, trying to skip maturity levels is usually counterproductive.

At the same time, you must recognize that process improvement efforts should focus on the needs of the organization in the context of its business environment and that process areas at higher maturity levels may address the current needs of an organization or project. For example, organizations seeking to move from maturity level 1 to maturity level 2 are frequently encouraged to establish a process group, which is addressed by the Organizational Process Focus process area that resides at maturity level 3. Although a process group is not a necessary characteristic of a maturity level 2 organization, it can be a useful part of the organization’s approach to achieving maturity level 2.

This situation is sometimes characterized as establishing a maturity level 1 process group to bootstrap the maturity level 1 organization to maturity level 2. Maturity level 1 process improvement activities may depend primarily on the insight and competence of the process group staff until an infrastructure to support more disciplined and widespread improvement is in place.

Organizations can institute specific process improvements at any time they choose, even before they are prepared to advance to the maturity level at which the specific practice is recommended. In such situations, however, organizations should understand that the success of these improvements is at risk because the foundation for their successful institutionalization has not been completed. Processes without the proper foundation may fail at the very point they are needed most—under stress.

A defined process that is characteristic of a maturity level 3 organization can be placed at great risk if maturity level 2 management practices are deficient. For example, management may commit to a poorly planned schedule or fail to control changes to baselined requirements. Similarly, many organizations prematurely collect the detailed data characteristic of maturity level 4, only to find the data uninterpretable because of inconsistencies in processes and measurement definitions.

Another example of using processes associated with higher maturity-level process areas is in the building of products. Certainly, we would expect maturity level 1 organizations to perform requirements analysis, design, integration, and verification. These activities are not described until maturity level 3, however, where they are described as the coherent, well-integrated engineering processes that complement a maturing project management capability, put in place so that the engineering improvements are not lost by an ad hoc management process.
[Process Areas]()

Process areas are viewed differently in the two representations. Figure 3.2 compares views of how process areas are used in the continuous representation and the staged representation.

Figure 3.2: Process Areas in Continuous and Staged Representations  

The continuous representation enables the organization to choose the focus of its process improvement efforts by choosing those process areas, or sets of interrelated process areas, that best benefit the organization and its business objectives. Although there are some limits on what an organization can choose because of the dependencies among process areas, the organization has considerable freedom in its selection.

To support those using the continuous representation, process areas are organized into four categories: Process Management, Project Management, Engineering, and Support. These categories emphasize the relationships that exist among the process areas and are discussed in Chapter 4.

Once you select the process areas, you must also select how much you would like to mature the processes associated with those process areas (i.e., select the appropriate capability level). Capability levels and generic goals and practices support the improvement of processes associated with individual process areas. For example, an organization may wish to strive to reach capability level 2 in one process area and capability level 4 in another. As the organization reaches a capability level, it sets its sights on the next capability level for one of these same process areas or decides to widen its view and address a larger number of process areas.

This selection is typically described through a target profile. A target profile defines all of the process areas to be addressed and the targeted capability level for each. This profile then governs which goals and practices the organization will address in its process improvement efforts.

Most organizations will, at minimum, target capability level 1, which requires that all specific goals of the process area be achieved. However, organizations that target capability levels higher than 1 will concentrate on the institutionalization of the selected processes in the organization by implementing the associated generic goals and practices.

Conversely, you will see that the staged representation encourages you to always look at process areas in the context of the maturity level to which they belong. The process areas are organized by maturity levels to reinforce this concept.

The staged representation provides a predetermined path of improvement from maturity level 1 to maturity level 5 that involves achieving the goals of the process areas at each maturity level. To support those using the staged representation, process areas are grouped by maturity level, indicating which process areas to implement to achieve each maturity level. For example, at maturity level 2, there is a set of process areas that an organization would use to guide its process improvement until it could achieve all the goals of all these process areas. Once maturity level 2 is achieved this way, the organization focuses its efforts on maturity level 3 process areas, and so on. The generic goals that apply to each process area are also predetermined. Generic goal 2 applies to maturity level 2 and generic goal 3 applies to maturity levels 3 through 5.

Table 3.2 provides a list of all process areas and their associated categories and maturity levels. To explain how the components of the process areas are viewed in each representation, we must discuss how the representations address specific practices.

[Generic Goals and Practices]()

Generic goals are required model components that apply to all process areas. Figure 3.3 illustrates the generic goals and practices. All of the generic goals and practices are used in the continuous representation. (See the Generic Goals and Generic Practices section on page 75 for a more detailed description of generic goals and practices.) The capability level you are targeting for your improvement effort will determine which generic goals and practices you will apply to the process area you have selected.

![]()

Figure 3.3: Generic Goals and Generic Practices

 

In the staged representation, only generic goals 2 and 3 are used, as illustrated by the generic practices highlighted in gray in Figure 3.3. When you try to reach maturity level 2, you use the process areas at maturity level 2 as well as generic goal 2 and its generic practices.

Notice that generic goals 4 and 5 and their associated generic practices are not used. This is because not all processes will be “raised” above (i.e., matured beyond) a defined process. Only select processes and subprocesses will be quantitatively managed and optimized, and which processes and subprocesses are selected is addressed by the process areas at maturity levels 4 and 5.

When you reach maturity levels 3, 4, and 5, you use the process areas at the appropriate maturity levels as well as all of those at the lower maturity levels. In addition, generic goal 3 and its associated generic practices (which include the generic practices associated with generic goal 2) are applied to all of these process areas. This means that even though you have already achieved a maturity level 2 rating, to achieve a maturity level 3 rating you must return to the maturity level 2 process areas and apply generic goal 3 and its generic practices as well.
[Representation Comparison]()

Table 3.3 summarizes the differences between the two representations.

 

Table 3.3 Comparing Continuous and Staged Representations
Continuous Representation
 
Staged Representation The organization selects process areas and capability levels based on its process improvement objectives.
 
The organization selects process areas based on the maturity levels. Improvement is measured using capability levels. Capability levels

·         Measure maturity of a particular process across an organization.

·         Range from 0 through 5.
 
Improvement is measured using maturity levels. Maturity levels

·         Measure maturity of a set of processes across an organization.

·         Range from 1 through 5. Capability level profiles are used to target and track process improvement performance.
 
Maturity levels are used to target and track process improvement performance. Equivalent staging allows an organization using the continuous approach to process improvement to derive a maturity level as part of an appraisal.
 
There is no need for an equivalence mechanism back to the continuous approach.

 

[Equivalent Staging]()

Equivalent staging is a way to compare results from using the continuous representation to those of the staged representation. In essence, if you measured improvement relative to selected process areas using capability levels in the continuous representation, how would you compare that to maturity levels? Is this possible?

Up to this point, we have not discussed process appraisals in much detail. The SCAMPISM method[[8]]() is used for appraising organizations using CMMI, and one result of an appraisal is a rating [Ahern 2005]. If the continuous representation is used for an appraisal, the rating is a capability level profile. If the staged representation is used for an appraisal, the rating is a maturity level (e.g., maturity level 3) rating.

A capability level profile is a list of process areas and the corresponding capability level achieved for each. This profile enables an organization to track its capability level by process area. The profile is an achievement profile when it represents the organization’s actual progress for each process area. Alternatively, the profile is a target profile when it represents the organization’s planned process improvement objectives. Figure 3.4 illustrates both a target profile and an achievement profile. The gray portion of each bar represents what has been achieved. The unshaded portion represents what remains to be accomplished to meet the target profile.

![]()

Figure 3.4: An Example of an Achievement Profile and a Target Profile

 

An achievement profile, when compared with a target profile, enables an organization to plan and track its progress for each selected process area. Maintaining capability level profiles is advisable when using the continuous representation.

Target staging is a sequence of target profiles that describes the path of process improvement to be followed by the organization. When building target profiles, the organization should pay attention to the dependencies between generic practices and process areas. If a generic practice depends on a certain process area, either to carry out the generic practice or to provide a prerequisite product, the generic practice may be much less effective when the process area is not implemented.[[9]]()

Although there are many reasons to use the continuous representation, the ratings provided by capability level profiles are limited in their ability to provide organizations with a way to generally compare themselves with other organizations. Capability level profiles could be used if each organization selected the same process areas; however, maturity levels have been used to compare organizations for years and already provide predefined sets of process areas.

Because of this situation, equivalent staging was created. Equivalent staging enables an organization using the continuous representation for an appraisal to convert a capability level profile to the associated maturity level rating.

The most effective way to depict equivalent staging is to provide a sequence of target profiles, each of which is equivalent to a maturity level rating of the staged representation. The result is a target staging that is equivalent to the maturity levels of the staged representation.

Figure 3.5 shows a summary of the target profiles that must be achieved when using the continuous representation to be equivalent to maturity levels 2 through 5. Each shaded area in the capability level columns represents a target profile that is equivalent to a maturity level.

Figure 3.5: Target Profiles and Equivalent Staging

The following rules summarize equivalent staging:

·         To achieve maturity level 2, all process areas assigned to maturity level 2 must achieve capability level 2 or higher.

·         To achieve maturity level 3, all process areas assigned to maturity levels 2 and 3 must achieve capability level 3 or higher.

·         To achieve maturity level 4, all process areas assigned to maturity levels 2, 3, and 4 must achieve capability level 3 or higher.

·         To achieve maturity level 5, all process areas must achieve capability level 3 or higher.

These rules and the table for equivalent staging are complete; however, you may ask why target profiles 4 and 5 do not extend into the CL4 and CL5 columns. The reason is that the maturity level 4 process areas describe a selection of the subprocesses to be stabilized based, in part, on the quality and process-performance objectives of the organization and projects. Not every process area will be addressed in the selection and CMMI does not presume in advance which process areas might be addressed in the selection.

So, the achievement of capability level 4 for process areas cannot be predetermined because the choices depend on the selections made by the organization in its implementation of the maturity level 4 process areas. Thus, Figure 3.5 does not show target profile 4 extending into the CL4 column, although some process areas will have achieved capability level 4. The situation for maturity level 5 and target profile 5 is similar.

The existence of equivalent staging should not discourage users of the continuous representation from establishing target profiles that extend above capability level 3. Such a target profile would be determined in part by the selections made by the organization to meet its business objectives.
# []()[]()[]()[]()[]()4     Relationships Among Process Areas

In this chapter, we describe interactions among process areas to help you see the organization’s view of process improvement and which process areas build on the implementation of other process areas. Relationships among process areas are presented in two dimensions.

The first dimension comprises the interactions of individual process areas that show how information and artifacts flow from one process area to another. Shown by the multiple figures and descriptions in this chapter, these interactions help you see a larger view of process improvement.

The second dimension comprises the interactions of groups of process areas. Shown by the classification of some process areas as Basic and others as Advanced, these classifications illustrate that the Basic process areas should be implemented before the Advanced process areas to ensure that the prerequisites are met to successfully implement the Advanced process areas.

Successful process improvement initiatives must be driven by the business objectives of the organization. For example, a common business objective is to reduce the time it takes to get a product to market. The process improvement objective derived from that might be to improve the project management processes to ensure on-time delivery; those improvements rely on best practices in the Project Planning and Project Monitoring and Control process areas.
[Four Categories of CMMI Process Areas]()

Process areas can be grouped into four categories:

·         Process Management

·         Project Management

·         Engineering

·         Support

Although we are grouping process areas this way to discuss their interactions, process areas often interact and have an effect on one another regardless of their defined group. For example, the Decision Analysis and Resolution process area provides specific practices to address the formal evaluation that is used in the Technical Solution process area for selecting a technical solution from alternative solutions. Technical Solution is an Engineering process area and Decision Analysis and Resolution is a Support process area.

Being aware of the interactions that exist among CMMI process areas and which process areas are Basic and Advanced will help you apply CMMI in a useful and productive way. The following sections describe the interactions of process areas within the categories and only briefly describe the interactions among process areas in other categories. Interactions among process areas that belong to different categories are described in references within the Related Process Areas section of the process areas in Part Two. Refer to Chapter 2 for more information about references.
[Process Management]()

Process Management process areas contain the cross-project activities related to defining, planning, deploying, implementing, monitoring, controlling, appraising, measuring, and improving processes.

The Process Management process areas of CMMI are as follows:

·         Organizational Process Focus

·         Organizational Process Definition +IPPD[[10]]()

·         Organizational Training

·         Organizational Process Performance

·         Organizational Innovation and Deployment
[Basic Process Management Process Areas]()

The Basic Process Management process areas provide the organization with a capability to document and share best practices, organizational process assets, and learning across the organization.

Figure 4.1 provides a bird’s-eye view of the interactions among the Basic Process Management process areas and with other process area categories. As illustrated in Figure 4.1, the Organizational Process Focus process area helps the organization to plan, implement, and deploy organizational process improvements based on an understanding of the current strengths and weaknesses of the organization’s processes and process assets.

![]()

Figure 4.1: Basic Process Management Process Areas

 

Candidate improvements to the organization’s processes are obtained through various means. These include process improvement proposals, measurement of the processes, lessons learned in implementing the processes, and results of process appraisal and product evaluation activities.

The Organizational Process Definition process area establishes and maintains the organization’s set of standard processes, work environment standards, and other assets based on the process needs and objectives of the organization. These other assets include descriptions of lifecycle models, process tailoring guidelines, and process-related documentation and data. Projects tailor the organization’s set of standard processes to create their defined processes. The other assets support tailoring as well as implementation of the defined processes. Experiences and work products from performing these defined processes, including measurement data, process descriptions, process artifacts, and lessons learned, are incorporated as appropriate into the organization’s set of standard processes and other assets. With the +IPPD addition, Organizational Process Definition +IPPD provides IPPD rules and guidelines to the projects.

The Organizational Training process area identifies the strategic training needs of the organization as well as the tactical training needs that are common across projects and support groups. In particular, training is developed or obtained to develop the skills required to perform the organization’s set of standard processes. The main components of training include a managed training development program, documented plans, personnel with appropriate knowledge, and mechanisms for measuring the effectiveness of the training program.
[Advanced Process Management Process Areas]()

The Advanced Process Management process areas provide the organization with an improved capability to achieve its quantitative objectives for quality and process performance.

Figure 4.2 provides a bird’s-eye view of the interactions among the Advanced Process Management process areas and with other process area categories. Each of the Advanced Process Management process areas depends on the ability to develop and deploy processes and supporting assets. The Basic Process Management process areas provide this ability.

![]()

Figure 4.2: Advanced Process Management Process Areas

 

As illustrated in Figure 4.2, the Organizational Process Performance process area derives quantitative objectives for quality and process performance from the organization’s business objectives. The organization provides projects and support groups with common measures, process-performance baselines, and process-performance models. These additional organizational assets support quantitative project management and statistical management of critical subprocesses for both projects and support groups. The organization analyzes the process-performance data collected from these defined processes to develop a quantitative understanding of product quality, service quality, and process performance of the organization’s set of standard processes.

The Organizational Innovation and Deployment process area selects and deploys proposed incremental and innovative improvements that improve the organization’s ability to meet its quality and process-performance objectives. The identification of promising incremental and innovative improvements should involve the participation of an empowered workforce aligned with the business values and objectives of the organization. The selection of improvements to deploy is based on a quantitative understanding of the likely benefits and predictable costs of deploying candidate improvements, and the funding available for such deployment.
[Project Management]()

Project Management process areas cover the project management activities related to planning, monitoring, and controlling the project.

The Project Management process areas of CMMI are as follows:

·         Project Planning

·         Project Monitoring and Control

·         Supplier Agreement Management

·         Integrated Project Management +IPPD[[11]]()

·         Risk Management

·         Quantitative Project Management
[Basic Project Management Process Areas]()

The Basic Project Management process areas address the activities related to establishing and maintaining the project plan, establishing and maintaining commitments, monitoring progress against the plan, taking corrective action, and managing supplier agreements.

Figure 4.3 provides a bird’s-eye view of the interactions among the Basic Project Management process areas and with other process area categories. As illustrated in Figure 4.3, the Project Planning process area includes developing the project plan, involving stakeholders appropriately, obtaining commitment to the plan, and maintaining the plan. When using IPPD, stakeholders represent not just the technical expertise for product and process development, but also the business implications of product and process development.

![]()

Figure 4.3:  Basic Project Management Process Areas

 

Planning begins with requirements that define the product and project (“What to Build” in Figure 4.3). The project plan covers the various project management and development activities performed by the project. The project reviews other plans that affect the project from various relevant stakeholders and establish commitments with those stakeholders for their contributions to the project. For example, these plans cover configuration management, verification, and measurement and analysis.

The Project Monitoring and Control process area includes monitoring activities and taking corrective action. The project plan specifies the appropriate level of project monitoring, the frequency of progress reviews, and the measures used to monitor progress. Progress is determined primarily by comparing project status to the plan. When the actual status deviates significantly from the expected values, corrective actions are taken as appropriate. These actions may include replanning.

The Supplier Agreement Management process area addresses the need of the project to acquire those portions of work that are produced by suppliers. Sources of products that may be used to satisfy project requirements are proactively identified. The supplier is selected, and a supplier agreement is established to manage the supplier. The supplier’s progress and performance are tracked by monitoring selected work products and processes, and the supplier agreement is revised as appropriate. Acceptance reviews and tests are conducted on the supplier-produced product component.
[Advanced Project Management Process Areas]()

The Advanced Project Management process areas address activities such as establishing a defined process that is tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes, establishing the project work environment from the organization’s work environment standards, coordinating and collaborating with relevant stakeholders, managing risk, forming and sustaining integrated teams for the conduct of projects, and quantitatively managing the project’s defined process.

Figure 4.4 provides a bird’s-eye view of the interactions among the Advanced Project Management process areas and with other process area categories. Each Advanced Project Management process area depends on the ability to plan, monitor, and control the project. The Basic Project Management process areas provide this ability.

![]()

Figure 4.4: Advanced Project Management Process Areas

The Integrated Project Management process area establishes and maintains the project’s defined process that is tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes. The project is managed using the project’s defined process. The project uses and contributes to the organization’s process assets. The project’s work environment is established and maintained from the organization’s work environment standards.

The management of the project ensures that the relevant stakeholders associated with the project coordinate their efforts in a timely manner. It does this by providing for the management of stakeholder involvement; the identification, negotiation, and tracking of critical dependencies; and the resolution of coordination issues within the project and with relevant stakeholders.

With the +IPPD addition, Integrated Project Management +IPPD establishes and maintains the shared vision of the project and an integrated team structure for the project and then establishes integrated teams to perform the work of the project, ensuring the appropriate collaboration across teams.

Although risk identification and monitoring are covered in the Project Planning and Project Monitoring and Control process areas, the Risk Management process area takes a continuing, forward-looking approach to managing risks with activities that include identification of risk parameters, risk assessments, and risk mitigation.

The Quantitative Project Management process area applies quantitative and statistical techniques to manage process performance and product quality. Quality and process-performance objectives for the project are based on the objectives established by the organization. The project’s defined process comprises, in part, process elements and subprocesses whose process performance can be predicted. At a minimum, the process variation experienced by subprocesses critical to achieving the project’s quality and process-performance objectives is understood. Corrective action is taken when special causes of process variation are identified. (See the definition of “special cause of process variation” in the glossary.)
[Engineering]()

Engineering process areas cover the development and maintenance activities that are shared across engineering disciplines. The Engineering process areas were written using general engineering terminology so that any technical discipline involved in the product development process (e.g., software engineering or mechanical engineering) can use them for process improvement.

The Engineering process areas also integrate the processes associated with different engineering disciplines into a single product development process, supporting a product-oriented process improvement strategy. Such a strategy targets essential business objectives rather than specific technical disciplines. This approach to processes effectively avoids the tendency toward an organizational “stovepipe” mentality.

The Engineering process areas apply to the development of any product or service in the development domain (e.g., software products, hardware products, services, or processes).

The technical foundation for IPPD is grounded in a robust systems engineering approach that encompasses development in the context of the phases of the product’s life. The Engineering process areas provide this technical foundation. The implementation of IPPD is further addressed through amplifications to specific practices in the Engineering process areas that emphasize concurrent development and focus on all phases of the product’s life.

The Engineering process areas of CMMI are as follows:

·         Requirements Development

·         Requirements Management

·         Technical Solution

·         Product Integration

·         Verification

·         Validation

Figure 4.5 provides a bird’s-eye view of the interactions among the six Engineering process areas.

Figure 4.5: Engineering Process Areas

 

The Requirements Development process area identifies customer needs and translates these needs into product requirements. The set of product requirements is analyzed to produce a high-level conceptual solution. This set of requirements is then allocated to establish an initial set of product component requirements. Other requirements that help define the product are derived and allocated to product components. This set of product and product component requirements clearly describes the product’s performance, design features, verification requirements, and so forth, in terms the developer understands and uses.

The Requirements Development process area supplies requirements to the Technical Solution process area, where the requirements are converted into the product architecture, the product component design, and the product component itself (e.g., coding and fabrication). Requirements are also supplied to the Product Integration process area, where product components are combined and interfaces are verified to ensure that they meet the interface requirements supplied by Requirements Development.

The Requirements Management process area maintains the requirements. It describes activities for obtaining and controlling requirement changes and ensuring that other relevant plans and data are kept current. It provides traceability of requirements from customer to product to product component.

Requirements Management ensures that changes to requirements are reflected in project plans, activities, and work products. This cycle of changes may affect all the other Engineering process areas; thus, requirements management is a dynamic and often recursive sequence of events. The Requirements Management process area is fundamental to a controlled and disciplined engineering design process.

The Technical Solution process area develops technical data packages for product components that will be used by the Product Integration or Supplier Agreement Management process area. Alternative solutions are examined with the intent of selecting the optimum design based on established criteria. These criteria may be significantly different across products, depending on product type, operational environment, performance requirements, support requirements, and cost or delivery schedules. The task of selecting the final solution makes use of the specific practices in the Decision Analysis and Resolution process area.

The Technical Solution process area relies on the specific practices in the Verification process area to perform design verification and peer reviews during design and prior to final build.

The Verification process area ensures that selected work products meet the specified requirements. The Verification process area selects work products and verification methods that will be used to verify work products against specified requirements. Verification is generally an incremental process, starting with product component verification and usually concluding with verification of fully assembled products.

Verification also addresses peer reviews. Peer reviews are a proven method for removing defects early and provide valuable insight into the work products and product components being developed and maintained.

The Validation process area incrementally validates products against the customer’s needs. Validation may be performed in the operational environment or in a simulated operational environment. Coordination with the customer on the validation requirements is an important element of this process area.

The scope of the Validation process area includes validation of products, product components, selected intermediate work products, and processes. These validated elements may often require reverification and revalidation. Issues discovered during validation are usually resolved in the Requirements Development or Technical Solution process area.

The Product Integration process area contains the specific practices associated with generating the best possible integration sequence, integrating product components, and delivering the product to the customer.

Product Integration uses the specific practices of both Verification and Validation in implementing the product integration process. Verification practices verify the interfaces and interface requirements of product components prior to product integration. This is an essential event in the integration process. During product integration in the operational environment, the specific practices of the Validation process area are used.
[Recursion and Iteration of Engineering Processes]()

Most process standards agree that there are two ways that processes can be applied. These two ways are called recursion and iteration.

Recursion occurs when a process is applied to successive levels of system elements within a system structure. The outcomes of one application are used as inputs to the next level in the system structure. For example, the verification process is designed to apply to the entire assembled product, the major product components, and even components of components. How far into the product you apply the verification process depends entirely on the size and complexity of the end product.

Iteration occurs when processes are repeated at the same system level. New information is created by the implementation of one process that feeds back into a related process. This new information typically raises questions that must be resolved before completing the processes. For example, iteration will most likely occur between requirements development and technical solution. Reapplication of the processes can resolve the questions that are raised. Iteration can ensure quality prior to applying the next process.

Engineering processes (e.g., requirements development or verification) are implemented repeatedly on a product to ensure that these engineering processes have been adequately addressed before delivery to the customer. Further, engineering processes are applied to components of the product. For example, some questions that are raised by processes associated with the Verification and Validation process areas may be resolved by processes associated with the Requirements Development or Product Integration process area. Recursion and iteration of these processes enable the project to ensure quality in all components of the product before it is delivered to the customer.
[Support]()

Support process areas cover the activities that support product development and maintenance. The Support process areas address processes that are used in the context of performing other processes. In general, the Support process areas address processes that are targeted toward the project and may address processes that apply more generally to the organization. For example, Process and Product Quality Assurance can be used with all the process areas to provide an objective evaluation of the processes and work products described in all the process areas.

The Support process areas of CMMI are as follows:

·         Configuration Management

·         Process and Product Quality Assurance

·         Measurement and Analysis

·         Decision Analysis and Resolution

·         Causal Analysis and Resolution
[Basic Support Process Areas]()

The Basic Support process areas address fundamental support functions that are used by all process areas. Although all Support process areas rely on the other process areas for input, the Basic Support process areas provide support functions that also help implement several generic practices.

Figure 4.6 provides a bird’s-eye view of the interactions among the Basic Support process areas and with all other process areas.

![]()

Figure 4.6: Basic Support Process Areas

 

The Measurement and Analysis process area supports all process areas by providing specific practices that guide projects and organizations in aligning measurement needs and objectives with a measurement approach that will provide objective results. These results can be used in making informed decisions and taking appropriate corrective actions.

The Process and Product Quality Assurance process area supports all process areas by providing specific practices for objectively evaluating performed processes, work products, and services against the applicable process descriptions, standards, and procedures, and ensuring that any issues arising from these reviews are addressed. Process and Product Quality Assurance supports the delivery of high-quality products and services by providing the project staff and all levels of managers with appropriate visibility into, and feedback on, the processes and associated work products throughout the life of the project.

The Configuration Management process area supports all process areas by establishing and maintaining the integrity of work products using configuration identification, configuration control, configuration status accounting, and configuration audits. The work products placed under configuration management include the products that are delivered to the customer, designated internal work products, acquired products, tools, and other items that are used in creating and describing these work products. Examples of work products that may be placed under configuration management include plans, process descriptions, requirements, design data, drawings, product specifications, code, compilers, product data files, and product technical publications.
[Advanced Support Process Areas]()

The Advanced Support process areas provide the projects and organization with an improved support capability. Each of these process areas relies on specific inputs or practices from other process areas.

Figure 4.7 provides a bird’s-eye view of the interactions among the Advanced Support process areas and with all other process areas.

![]()

Figure 4.7: Advanced Support Process Areas

Using the Causal Analysis and Resolution process area, project members identify causes of selected defects and other problems and take action to prevent them from occurring in the future. While the project’s defined processes are the principal targets for identifying the cause of the defect, the process improvement proposals they create target the organization’s set of standard processes, which will prevent recurrence of the defect across the organization.

The Decision Analysis and Resolution process area supports all the process areas by determining which issues should be subjected to a formal evaluation process and then applying a formal evaluation process to them.
# []()[]()[]()[]()[]()5     Using CMMI Models

The complexity of today’s products demands an integrated view of how organizations do business. CMMI can reduce the cost of process improvement across enterprises that depend on multiple functions or groups to produce products and services.

To achieve this integrated view, the CMMI Framework includes common terminology, common model components, common appraisal methods, and common training materials. This chapter describes how organizations can use the CMMI Product Suite not only to improve their quality, reduce their costs, and optimize their schedules, but also to gauge how well their process improvement program is working.
[Adopting CMMI]()

Research has shown that the most powerful initial step to process improvement is to build strong organizational support through strong senior management sponsorship. To gain senior management sponsorship, it is often beneficial to expose senior management to the performance results experienced by others who have used CMMI to improve their processes.

For more information about CMMI performance results, see the SEI Web site at www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/results.html [SEI 3].

The senior manager, once committed as the process improvement sponsor, must be actively involved in the CMMI-based process improvement effort. Activities performed by the senior management sponsor include (but are not limited to) the following:

·         Influence the organization to adopt CMMI.

·         Choose the best people to manage the process improvement effort.

·         Monitor the process improvement effort personally.

·         Be a visible advocate and spokesperson for the process improvement effort.

·         Ensure that adequate resources are available to enable the process improvement effort to be successful.

Given sufficient senior management sponsorship, the next step is establishing a strong, technically competent process group that represents relevant stakeholders to guide process improvement efforts.

For an organization with a mission to develop software-intensive systems, the process group might include engineers representing the different technical disciplines across the organization and other selected members based on the business needs driving improvement. For example, a systems administrator may focus on information-technology support, whereas a marketing representative may focus on integrating customers’ needs. Both members could make powerful contributions to the process group.

Once your organization has decided to adopt CMMI, planning can begin with an improvement approach such as the IDEALSM (Initiating, Diagnosing, Establishing, Acting, & Learning) model. For more information about the IDEAL model, see the SEI Web site at www.sei.cmu.edu/ideal/ideal.html [SEI 1].
[Your Process Improvement Program]()

Use the CMMI Product Suite to help establish your organization’s process improvement program. Using the product suite for this purpose can be a relatively informal process that involves understanding and applying CMMI best practices to your organization. Or, it can be a formal process that involves extensive training, creation of a process improvement infrastructure, appraisals, and more.

[Selections That Influence Your Program]()

You must make three selections to apply CMMI to your organization for process improvement:

1.    Select a part of the organization.

2.    Select a model.

3.    Select a representation.

 

Selecting the projects to be involved in your process improvement program is critical. If you select a group that is too large, it may be too much for the initial improvement effort. The selection should also consider how homogeneous the group is (i.e., whether they all are software engineers, whether they all work on the same product or business line, and so on).

Selecting the model to be used depends on the areas your organization is interested in improving. Not only must you select a constellation (e.g., Development, Acquisition, or Services), but you must also decide whether to include any additions (e.g., IPPD).

The process of selecting the representation to be used has some guidelines because of how CMMI models are built. If your organization likes the idea of maturity levels and the staged representation, your improvement roadmap is already defined. If your organization likes the continuous representation, you can select nearly any process area or group of process areas to guide improvement, although dependencies among process areas should be considered when making such a selection.

As the process improvement plans and activities progress, other important selections must be made, including which appraisal method should be used, which projects should be appraised, how training for personnel should be secured, and which personnel should be trained.
[CMMI Models]()

CMMI models describe what have been determined to be best practices that organizations have found to be productive and useful to achieving their business objectives.

Regardless of your type of organization, to apply CMMI best practices, you must use professional judgment when interpreting them for your situation, needs, and business objectives. Although process areas depict the characteristics of an organization committed to process improvement, you must interpret the process areas using an in-depth knowledge of CMMI, your organization, the business environment, and the specific circumstances involved.

As you begin using a CMMI model to improve your organization’s processes, map your real-world processes to CMMI process areas. This mapping enables you to initially judge and later track your organization’s level of conformance to the CMMI model you are using and to identify opportunities for improvement.

To interpret practices, it is important to consider the overall context in which these practices are used and to determine how well the practices satisfy the goals of a process area in that context. CMMI models do not explicitly prescribe nor imply particular processes that are right for any organization or project. Instead, CMMI describes minimal criteria necessary to plan and implement processes selected by the organization for improvement based on business objectives.

CMMI practices purposely use nonspecific phrases such as “relevant stakeholders,” “as appropriate,” and “as necessary” to accommodate the needs of different organizations and projects. The specific needs of a project may also differ at various points during its life.
[Using CMMI Appraisals]()

Many organizations find value in measuring their progress by conducting an appraisal and thus earning a maturity level rating or a capability level achievement profile. These appraisals are typically conducted for one or more of the following reasons:

·         To determine how well the organization’s processes compare to CMMI best practices and identify areas where improvement can be made

·         To inform external customers and suppliers about how well the organization’s processes compare to CMMI best practices

·         To meet the contract requirements of one or more customers

Appraisals of organizations using a CMMI model must conform to the requirements defined in the Appraisal Requirements for CMMI (ARC) document. These appraisals focus on identifying improvement opportunities and comparing the organization’s processes to CMMI best practices. Appraisal teams use a CMMI model and ARC-conformant appraisal method to guide their evaluation of the organization as well as how they report their conclusions. The appraisal results are then used (by a process group, for example) to plan improvements for the organization.
[Appraisal Requirements for CMMI]()

The ARC document describes the requirements for several types of appraisals. A full benchmarking class of appraisal is defined as a Class A appraisal. Less formal methods are defined as Class B or Class C methods. The ARC document was designed to help improve consistency across appraisal methods, and to help appraisal method developers, sponsors, and users understand the tradeoffs associated with various methods [SEI 2006a].

Depending on the purpose of the appraisal and the nature of the circumstances, one class may be preferred over the others. Sometimes self-assessments, initial appraisals, quick-look, or mini-appraisals, incremental appraisals, or external appraisals are appropriate, and other times a formal benchmarking appraisal is appropriate.

A particular appraisal method is declared an ARC Class A, B, or C appraisal method based on the sets of ARC requirements that the method developer addressed when designing the method.

More information about the ARC is available on the SEI Web site at www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/appraisals/appraisals.html.
[SCAMPI Appraisal Methods]()

The SCAMPI appraisal methods are the generally accepted methods used for conducting appraisals using CMMI models. The SCAMPI Method Definition Document (MDD) defines rules for ensuring the consistency of appraisal ratings. For benchmarking against other organizations, appraisals must ensure consistent ratings. The achievement of a specific maturity level or the satisfaction of a process area must mean the same thing for different appraised organizations.

The SCAMPI family of appraisals includes Class A, B, and C appraisal methods. SCAMPI A is the most rigorous method and the only method that can result in a rating. SCAMPI B provides options in model scope, but the characterization of practices is fixed to one scale and is performed on implemented practices. SCAMPI C provides a wide range of options, including characterization of planned approaches to process implementation according to a scale defined by the user.

More information about SCAMPI methods is available on the SEI Web site at www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/appraisals/appraisals.html [SEI 2006b].
[Appraisal Considerations]()

Choices that affect a CMMI-based appraisal include the following:

·         Which CMMI model to use for the appraisal (for this constellation, the choice would be between the CMMI for Development model and the CMMI for Development +IPPD model)

·         Establishing the appraisal scope, including the organizational unit to be appraised, the CMMI process areas to be investigated, and the maturity level or capability level(s) to be appraised

·         Selecting the appraisal method

·         Selecting the appraisal team members

·         Selecting appraisal participants from the appraisal entities to be interviewed

·         Establishing appraisal outputs (e.g., ratings or instantiation-specific findings)

·         Establishing appraisal constraints (e.g., time spent on site)

The SCAMPI MDD allows the selection of predefined options for use in an appraisal. These appraisal options are designed to help organizations align CMMI with their business needs and objectives.

Documentation of CMMI appraisal plans and results must always include a description of the appraisal options, model scope, and organizational scope selected. This documentation confirms whether an appraisal meets the requirements for benchmarking.

For organizations that wish to appraise multiple functions or groups, CMMI’s integrated approach enables some economy of scale in model and appraisal training. One appraisal method can provide separate or combined results for multiple functions.

The appraisal principles for the CMMI Product Suite[[12]]() remain the same as those used in appraisals for other process improvement models. Those principles are as follows:

·         Senior management sponsorship[[13]]()

·         A focus on the organization’s business objectives

·         Confidentiality for interviewees

·         Use of a documented appraisal method

·         Use of a process reference model (e.g., a CMMI model) as a base

·         A collaborative team approach

·         A focus on actions for process improvement
[CMMI-Related Training]()

Whether your organization is new to process improvement or is already familiar with process improvement models, training is a key element in the ability of organizations to adopt CMMI. An initial set of courses is provided by the SEI and its Partners, but your organization may wish to supplement these courses with internal instruction. This approach allows your organization to focus on the areas that provide the greatest business value.

The SEI and its Partners offer the Introduction to CMMI course, which provides a basic overview of the CMMI models. The SEI also offers the Intermediate Concepts of CMMI course to those who plan to become more deeply involved in CMMI adoption or appraisal—for example, those who will guide improvement as part of a process group, those who will lead SCAMPI appraisals, and those who will teach the Introduction to CMM course. Current information about CMMI-related training is available on the SEI Web site at []()[]()[]()[www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/training/training.html](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/training/training.html).
[Part Two]()

[]()[]()[Generic]() Goals and Generic Practices, and the Process Areas
 ****  ****

[]()[]()Generic Goals and Generic Practices

[Overview]()

This section describes, in detail, all the generic goals and generic practices of CMMI—model components that directly address process institutionalization.

In the process areas, generic goals and generic practices appear at the end of each process area. Generic practice elaborations appear after generic practices to show how these practices should uniquely be applied to the process area.

The entire text of the generic goals and generic practices is not repeated in the process areas (i.e., subpractices, notes, examples, and references are omitted). Instead, only the generic goal and generic practice titles and statements appear. As you address each process area, refer to this section for the details of all generic practices.
[Process Institutionalization]()

Institutionalization is an important concept in process improvement. When mentioned in the generic goal and generic practice descriptions, institutionalization implies that the process is ingrained in the way the work is performed and there is commitment and consistency to performing the process.

An institutionalized process is more likely to be retained during times of stress. When the requirements and objectives for the process change, however, the implementation of the process may also need to change to ensure that it remains effective. The generic practices describe activities that address these aspects of institutionalization.

The degree of institutionalization is embodied in the generic goals and expressed in the names of the processes associated with each goal as indicated in Table 6.1.

 

Table 6.1 Generic Goals and Process Names
Generic Goal
  
Progression of Processes GG 1
  
Performed process GG 2
  
Managed process GG 3
  
Defined process GG 4
  
Quantitatively managed process GG 5
  
Optimizing process

 

The progression of process institutionalization is characterized in the following descriptions of each process.
[Performed Process]()

A performed process is a process that accomplishes the work necessary to produce work products. The specific goals of the process area are satisfied.

[Managed Process]()

A managed process is a performed process that is planned and executed in accordance with policy; employs skilled people who have adequate resources to produce controlled outputs; involves relevant stakeholders; is monitored, controlled, and reviewed; and is evaluated for adherence to its process description. The process may be instantiated by a project, group, or organizational function. Management of the process is concerned with institutionalization and the achievement of other specific objectives established for the process, such as cost, schedule, and quality objectives. The control provided by a managed process helps to ensure that the established process is retained during times of stress.

The requirements and objectives for the process are established by the organization. The status of the work products and delivery of the services are visible to management at defined points (e.g., at major milestones and completion of major tasks). Commitments are established among those performing the work and the relevant stakeholders and are revised as necessary. Work products are reviewed with relevant stakeholders and are controlled. The work products and services satisfy their specified requirements.

A critical distinction between a performed process and a managed process is the extent to which the process is managed. A managed process is planned (the plan may be part of a more encompassing plan) and the performance of the process is managed against the plan. Corrective actions are taken when the actual results and performance deviate significantly from the plan. A managed process achieves the objectives of the plan and is institutionalized for consistent performance.
[Defined Process]()

A defined process is a managed process that is tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes according to the organization’s tailoring guidelines; has a maintained process description; and contributes work products, measures, and other process improvement information to the organizational process assets.

The organizational process assets are artifacts that relate to describing, implementing, and improving processes. These artifacts are assets because they are developed or acquired to meet the business objectives of the organization, and they represent investments by the organization that are expected to provide current and future business value.

The organization’s set of standard processes, which are the basis of the defined process, are established and improved over time. Standard processes describe the fundamental process elements that are expected in the defined processes. Standard processes also describe the relationships (e.g., the ordering and the interfaces) among these process elements. The organization-level infrastructure to support current and future use of the organization’s set of standard processes is established and improved over time. (See the definition of “standard process” in the glossary.)

A project’s defined process provides a basis for planning, performing, and improving the project’s tasks and activities. A project may have more than one defined process (e.g., one for developing the product and another for testing the product).

A defined process clearly states the following:

·         Purpose

·         Inputs

·         Entry criteria

·         Activities

·         Roles

·         Measures

·         Verification steps

·         Outputs

·         Exit criteria

A critical distinction between a managed process and a defined process is the scope of application of the process descriptions, standards, and procedures. For a managed process, the process descriptions, standards, and procedures are applicable to a particular project, group, or organizational function. As a result, the managed processes of two projects in one organization may be different.

Another critical distinction is that a defined process is described in more detail and is performed more rigorously than a managed process. This means that improvement information is easier to understand, analyze, and use. Finally, management of the defined process is based on the additional insight provided by an understanding of the interrelationships of the process activities and detailed measures of the process, its work products, and its services.
[Quantitatively Managed Process]()

A quantitatively managed process is a defined process that is controlled using statistical and other quantitative techniques. The product quality, service quality, and process-performance attributes are measurable and controlled throughout the project.

Quantitative objectives are established based on the capability of the organization’s set of standard processes; the organization’s business objectives; and the needs of the customer, end users, organization, and process implementers, subject to the availability of resources. The people performing the process are directly involved in quantitatively managing the process.

Quantitative management is performed on the overall set of processes that produces a product. The subprocesses that are significant contributors to overall process performance are statistically managed. For these selected subprocesses, detailed measures of process performance are collected and statistically analyzed. Special causes of process variation are identified and, where appropriate, the source of the special cause is addressed to prevent its recurrence.

The quality and process-performance measures are incorporated into the organization’s measurement repository to support future fact-based decision making.

Activities for quantitatively managing the performance of a process include the following:

·         Identifying the subprocesses that are to be brought under statistical management

·         Identifying and measuring product and process attributes that are important contributors to quality and process performance

·         Identifying and addressing special causes of subprocess variations (based on the selected product and process attributes and subprocesses selected for statistical management)

·         Managing each of the selected subprocesses, with the objective of bringing their performance within natural bounds (i.e., making the subprocess performance statistically stable and predictable based on the selected product and process attributes)

·         Predicting the ability of the process to satisfy established quantitative quality and process-performance objectives

·         Taking appropriate corrective actions when it is determined that the established quantitative quality and process-performance objectives will not be satisfied

These corrective actions include changing the objectives or ensuring that relevant stakeholders have a quantitative understanding of, and have agreed to, the performance shortfall.

A critical distinction between a defined process and a quantitatively managed process is the predictability of process performance. The term quantitatively managed implies using appropriate statistical and other quantitative techniques to manage the performance of one or more critical subprocesses so that the performance of the process can be predicted. A defined process provides only qualitative predictability.
[Optimizing Process]()

An optimizing process is a quantitatively managed process that is changed and adapted to meet relevant current and projected business objectives. An optimizing process focuses on continually improving process performance through both incremental and innovative technological improvements. Process improvements that address common causes of process variation, root causes of defects, and other problems; and those that would measurably improve the organization’s processes are identified, evaluated, and deployed as appropriate. These improvements are selected based on a quantitative understanding of their expected contribution to achieving the organization’s process improvement objectives versus the cost and impact to the organization.

Selected incremental and innovative technological process improvements are systematically managed and deployed into the organization. The effects of the deployed process improvements are measured and evaluated against the quantitative process improvement objectives.

In a process that is optimized, common causes of process variation are addressed by changing the process in a way that will shift the mean or decrease variation when the process is restabilized. These changes are intended to improve process performance and to achieve the organization’s established process improvement objectives.

A critical distinction between a quantitatively managed process and an optimizing process is that the optimizing process is continuously improved by addressing common causes of process variation. A quantitatively managed process is concerned with addressing special causes of process variation and providing statistical predictability of the results. Although the process may produce predictable results, the results may be insufficient to achieve the organization’s process improvement objectives.
[Relationships among Processes]()

The generic goals evolve so that each goal provides a foundation for the next. Therefore the following conclusions can be made:

·         A managed process is a performed process.

·         A defined process is a managed process.

·         A quantitatively managed process is a defined process.

·         An optimizing process is a quantitatively managed process.

Thus, applied sequentially and in order, the generic goals describe a process that is increasingly institutionalized from a performed process to an optimizing process.

Achieving GG 1 for a process area is equivalent to saying you achieve the specific goals of the process area.

Achieving GG 2 for a process area is equivalent to saying you manage the performance of processes associated with the process area. There is a policy that indicates you will perform it. There is a plan for performing it. There are resources provided, responsibilities assigned, training on how to perform it, selected work products from performing the process are controlled, and so on. In other words, the process is planned and monitored just like any project or support activity.

Achieving GG 3 for a process area assumes that an organizational standard process exists that can be tailored to result in the process you will use. Tailoring might result in making no changes to the standard process. In other words, the process used and the standard process may be identical. Using the standard process “as is” is tailoring because the choice is made that no modification is required.

Each process area describes multiple activities, some of which are repeatedly performed. You may need to tailor the way one of these activities is performed to account for new capabilities or circumstances. For example, you may have a standard for developing or obtaining organizational training that does not consider Web-based training. When preparing to develop or obtain a Web-based course, you may need to tailor the standard process to account for the particular challenges and benefits of Web-based training.

Achieving GG 4 or GG 5 for a process area is conceptually feasible but may not be economical except, perhaps, in situations where the product domain has become stable for an extended period or in situations in which the process area or domain is a critical business driver.
[Generic Goals and Generic Practices]()

This section describes all of the generic goals and generic practices, as well as their associated subpractices, notes, examples, and references. The generic goals are organized in numerical order, GG 1 through GG 5. The generic practices are also organized in numerical order under the generic goal they support.

As mentioned earlier, the subpractices, notes, examples, and references are not repeated in the process areas; the details of each generic goal and generic practice are found only here.
GG 1            Achieve Specific Goals

The process supports and enables achievement of the specific goals of the process area by transforming identifiable input work products to produce identifiable output work products.

GP 1.1         Perform Specific Practices

Perform the specific practices of the process area to develop work products and provide services to achieve the specific goals of the process area.

The purpose of this generic practice is to produce the work products and deliver the services that are expected by performing the process. These practices may be done informally, without following a documented process description or plan. The rigor with which these practices are performed depends on the individuals managing and performing the work and may vary considerably.
GG 2            Institutionalize a Managed Process

The process is institutionalized as a managed process.

GP 2.1         Establish an Organizational Policy

Establish and maintain an organizational policy for planning and performing the process.

The purpose of this generic practice is to define the organizational expectations for the process and make these expectations visible to those in the organization who are affected. In general, senior management is responsible for establishing and communicating guiding principles, direction, and expectations for the organization.

Not all direction from senior management will bear the label “policy.” The existence of appropriate organizational direction is the expectation of this generic practice, regardless of what it is called or how it is imparted.
GP 2.2         Plan the Process

Establish and maintain the plan for performing the process.

The purpose of this generic practice is to determine what is needed to perform the process and to achieve the established objectives, to prepare a plan for performing the process, to prepare a process description, and to get agreement on the plan from relevant stakeholders.

The practical implications of applying a generic practice vary for each process area. For example, the planning described by this generic practice as applied to the Project Monitoring and Control process area may be carried out in full by the processes associated with the Project Planning process area. However, this generic practice, when applied to the Project Planning process area, sets an expectation that the project planning process itself be planned. Therefore, this generic practice may either reinforce expectations set elsewhere in CMMI or set new expectations that should be addressed.

Refer to the Project Planning process area for more information on establishing and maintaining a project plan.

Establishing a plan includes documenting the plan and a process description. Maintaining the plan includes updating it to reflect corrective actions or changes in requirements or objectives.

The plan for performing the process typically includes the following:

·         Process description

·         Standards and requirements for the work products and services of the process

·         Specific objectives for the performance of the process (e.g., quality, time scale, cycle time, and resource usage)

·         Dependencies among the activities, work products, and services of the process

·         Resources (including funding, people, and tools) needed to perform the process

·         Assignment of responsibility and authority

·         Training needed for performing and supporting the process

·         Work products to be controlled and the level of control to be applied

·         Measurement requirements to provide insight into the performance of the process, its work products, and its services

·         Involvement of identified stakeholders

·         Activities for monitoring and controlling the process

·         Objective evaluation activities of the process

·         Management review activities for the process and the work products

Subpractices

1.    Define and document the plan for performing the process.

This plan may be a stand-alone document, embedded in a more comprehensive document, or distributed across multiple documents. In the case of the plan being distributed across multiple documents, ensure that a coherent picture of who does what is preserved. Documents may be hardcopy or softcopy.

2.    Define and document the process description.

The process description, which includes relevant standards and procedures, may be included as part of the plan for performing the process or may be included in the plan by reference.

3.    Review the plan with relevant stakeholders and get their agreement.

This includes reviewing that the planned process satisfies the applicable policies, plans, requirements, and standards to provide assurance to relevant stakeholders.

4.    Revise the plan as necessary.
GP 2.3         Provide Resources

Provide adequate resources for performing the process, developing the work products, and providing the services of the process.

The purpose of this generic practice is to ensure that the resources necessary to perform the process as defined by the plan are available when they are needed. Resources include adequate funding, appropriate physical facilities, skilled people, and appropriate tools.

The interpretation of the term “adequate” depends on many factors and can change over time. Inadequate resources may be addressed by increasing resources or by removing requirements, constraints, and commitments.
GP 2.4         Assign Responsibility

Assign responsibility and authority for performing the process, developing the work products, and providing the services of the process.

The purpose of this generic practice is to ensure that there is accountability for performing the process and achieving the specified results throughout the life of the process. The people assigned must have the appropriate authority to perform the assigned responsibilities.

Responsibility can be assigned using detailed job descriptions or in living documents, such as the plan for performing the process. Dynamic assignment of responsibility is another legitimate way to perform this generic practice, as long as the assignment and acceptance of responsibility are ensured throughout the life of the process.

Subpractices

1.    Assign overall responsibility and authority for performing the process.

2.    Assign responsibility and authority for performing the specific tasks of the process.

3.    Confirm that the people assigned to the responsibilities and authorities understand and accept them.
GP 2.5         Train People

Train the people performing or supporting the process as needed.

The purpose of this generic practice is to ensure that the people have the necessary skills and expertise to perform or support the process.

Appropriate training is provided to the people who will be performing the work. Overview training is provided to orient people who interact with those performing the work.

Examples of methods for providing training include self-study; self-directed training; self-paced, programmed instruction; formalized on-the-job training; mentoring; and formal and classroom training.

Training supports the successful performance of the process by establishing a common understanding of the process and by imparting the skills and knowledge needed to perform the process.

Refer to the Organizational Training process area for more information about training the people performing or supporting the process.
GP 2.6         Manage Configurations

Place designated work products of the process under appropriate levels of control.

The purpose of this generic practice is to establish and maintain the integrity of the designated work products of the process (or their descriptions) throughout their useful life.

The designated work products are specifically identified in the plan for performing the process, along with a specification of the appropriate level of control.

Different levels of control are appropriate for different work products and for different points in time. For some work products, it may be sufficient to maintain version control (i.e., the version of the work product in use at a given time, past or present, is known, and changes are incorporated in a controlled manner). Version control is usually under the sole control of the work product owner (which may be an individual, a group, or a team).

Sometimes, it may be critical that work products be placed under formal or baseline configuration management. This type of control includes defining and establishing baselines at predetermined points. These baselines are formally reviewed and agreed on, and serve as the basis for further development of the designated work products.

Refer to the Configuration Management process area for more information about placing work products under configuration management.

Additional levels of control between version control and formal configuration management are possible. An identified work product may be under various levels of control at different points in time.
GP 2.7         Identify and Involve Relevant Stakeholders

Identify and involve the relevant stakeholders of the process as planned.

The purpose of this generic practice is to establish and maintain the expected involvement of stakeholders during the execution of the process.

Involve relevant stakeholders as described in an appropriate plan for stakeholder involvement. Involve stakeholders appropriately in activities such as the following:

·         Planning

·         Decisions

·         Commitments

·         Communications

·         Coordination

·         Reviews

·         Appraisals

·         Requirements definitions

·         Resolution of problems/issues

Refer to the Project Planning process area for information on the project planning for stakeholder involvement.

The objective of planning stakeholder involvement is to ensure that interactions necessary to the process are accomplished, while not allowing excessive numbers of affected groups and individuals to impede process execution.

Subpractices

1.    Identify stakeholders relevant to this process and their appropriate involvement.

Relevant stakeholders are identified among the suppliers of inputs to, the users of outputs from, and the performers of the activities within the process. Once the relevant stakeholders are identified, the appropriate level of their involvement in process activities is planned.

2.    Share these identifications with project planners or other planners as appropriate.

3.    Involve relevant stakeholders as planned.
GP 2.8         Monitor and Control the Process

Monitor and control the process against the plan for performing the process and take appropriate corrective action.

The purpose of this generic practice is to perform the direct day-to-day monitoring and controlling of the process. Appropriate visibility into the process is maintained so that appropriate corrective action can be taken when necessary. Monitoring and controlling the process involves measuring appropriate attributes of the process or work products produced by the process.

Refer to the Project Monitoring and Control process area for more information about monitoring and controlling the project and taking corrective action.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for more information about measurement.

Subpractices

1.    Measure actual performance against the plan for performing the process.

The measures are of the process, its work products, and its services.

2.    Review accomplishments and results of the process against the plan for performing the process.

3.    Review activities, status, and results of the process with the immediate level of management responsible for the process and identify issues. The reviews are intended to provide the immediate level of management with appropriate visibility into the process. The reviews can be both periodic and event driven.

4.    Identify and evaluate the effects of significant deviations from the plan for performing the process.

5.    Identify problems in the plan for performing the process and in the execution of the process.

6.    Take corrective action when requirements and objectives are not being satisfied, when issues are identified, or when progress differs significantly from the plan for performing the process.

There are inherent risks that should be considered before any corrective action is taken.

Corrective action may include the following:

·       Taking remedial action to repair defective work products or services

·       Changing the plan for performing the process

·       Adjusting resources, including people, tools, and other resources

·       Negotiating changes to the established commitments

·       Securing change to the requirements and objectives that have to be satisfied

·       Terminating the effort

7.    Track corrective action to closure.
GP 2.9         Objectively Evaluate Adherence

Objectively evaluate adherence of the process against its process description, standards, and procedures, and address noncompliance.

The purpose of this generic practice is to provide credible assurance that the process is implemented as planned and adheres to its process description, standards, and procedures. This generic practice is implemented, in part, by evaluating selected work products of the process. (See the definition of objectively evaluate in the glossary.)

Refer to the Process and Product Quality Assurance process area for more information about objectively evaluating adherence.

People not directly responsible for managing or performing the activities of the process typically evaluate adherence. In many cases, adherence is evaluated by people within the organization, but external to the process or project, or by people external to the organization. As a result, credible assurance of adherence can be provided even during times when the process is under stress (e.g., when the effort is behind schedule or over budget).
GP 2.10       Review Status with Higher Level Management

Review the activities, status, and results of the process with higher level management and resolve issues.

The purpose of this generic practice is to provide higher level management with the appropriate visibility into the process.

Higher level management includes those levels of management in the organization above the immediate level of management responsible for the process. In particular, higher level management includes senior management. These reviews are for managers who provide the policy and overall guidance for the process, and not for those who perform the direct day-to-day monitoring and controlling of the process.

Different managers have different needs for information about the process. These reviews help ensure that informed decisions on the planning and performing of the process can be made. Therefore, these reviews are expected to be both periodic and event driven.
GG 3            Institutionalize a Defined Process

The process is institutionalized as a defined process.

GP 3.1         Establish a Defined Process

Establish and maintain the description of a defined process.

The purpose of this generic practice is to establish and maintain a description of the process that is tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes to address the needs of a specific instantiation. The organization should have standard processes that cover the process area, as well as have guidelines for tailoring these standard processes to meet the needs of a project or organizational function. With a defined process, variability in how the processes are performed across the organization is reduced and process assets, data, and learning can be effectively shared.

Refer to the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about the organization’s set of standard processes and tailoring guidelines.

Refer to the Integrated Project Management process area for more information on establishing and maintaining the project’s defined process.

The descriptions of the defined processes provide the basis for planning, performing, and managing the activities, work products, and services associated with the process.

Subpractices

1.    Select from the organization’s set of standard processes those processes that cover the process area and best meet the needs of the project or organizational function.

2.    Establish the defined process by tailoring the selected processes according to the organization’s tailoring guidelines.

3.    Ensure that the organization’s process objectives are appropriately addressed in the defined process.

4.    Document the defined process and the records of the tailoring.

5.    Revise the description of the defined process as necessary.
GP 3.2         Collect Improvement Information

Collect work products, measures, measurement results, and improvement information derived from planning and performing the process to support the future use and improvement of the organization’s processes and process assets.

The purpose of this generic practice is to collect information and artifacts derived from planning and performing the process. This generic practice is performed so that the information and artifacts can be included in the organizational process assets and made available to those who are (or who will be) planning and performing the same or similar processes. The information and artifacts are stored in the organization’s measurement repository and the organization’s process asset library.
Examples of relevant information include the effort expended for the various activities, defects injected or removed in a particular activity, and lessons learned.

 

Refer to the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about the organization’s measurement repository and process asset library and for more information about the work products, measures, and improvement information that are incorporated into the organizational process assets.

Refer to the Integrated Project Management process area for more information on contributing work products, measures, and documented experiences to the organizational process assets.

Subpractices

1.    Store process and product measures in the organization’s measurement repository.

The process and product measures are primarily those that are defined in the common set of measures for the organization’s set of standard processes.

2.    Submit documentation for inclusion in the organization’s process asset library.

3.    Document lessons learned from the process for inclusion in the organization’s process asset library.

4.    Propose improvements to the organizational process assets.
GG 4            Institutionalize a Quantitatively Managed Process

The process is institutionalized as a quantitatively managed process.

GP 4.1         Establish Quantitative Objectives for the Process

Establish and maintain quantitative objectives for the process, which address quality and process performance, based on customer needs and business objectives.

The purpose of this generic practice is to determine and obtain agreement from relevant stakeholders about specific quantitative objectives for the process. These quantitative objectives can be expressed in terms of product quality, service quality, and process performance.

Refer to the Quantitative Project Management process area for information on how quantitative objectives are set for subprocesses of the project’s defined process.

The quantitative objectives may be specific to the process or they may be defined for a broader scope (e.g., for a set of processes). In the latter case, these quantitative objectives may be allocated to some of the included processes.

These quantitative objectives are criteria used to judge whether the products, services, and process performance will satisfy the customers, end users, organization management, and process implementers. These quantitative objectives go beyond the traditional end-product objectives. They also cover intermediate objectives that are used to manage the achievement of the objectives over time. They reflect, in part, the demonstrated performance of the organization’s set of standard processes. These quantitative objectives should be set to values that are likely to be achieved when the processes involved are stable and within their natural bounds.

Subpractices

1.    Establish the quantitative objectives that pertain to the process.

2.    Allocate the quantitative objectives to the process or its subprocesses.
GP 4.2         Stabilize Subprocess Performance

Stabilize the performance of one or more subprocesses to determine the ability of the process to achieve the established quantitative quality and process-performance objectives.

The purpose of this generic practice is to stabilize the performance of one or more subprocesses of the defined process, which are critical contributors to overall performance, using appropriate statistical and other quantitative techniques. Stabilizing selected subprocesses supports predicting the ability of the process to achieve the established quantitative quality and process-performance objectives.

Refer to the Quantitative Project Management process area for information on selecting subprocesses for statistical management, monitoring performance of subprocesses, and other aspects of stabilizing subprocess performance.

A stable subprocess shows no significant indication of special causes of process variation. Stable subprocesses are predictable within the limits established by the natural bounds of the subprocess. Variations in the stable subprocess are due to a constant system of chance causes, and the magnitude of the variations can be small or large.

Predicting the ability of the process to achieve the established quantitative objectives requires a quantitative understanding of the contributions of the subprocesses that are critical to achieving these objectives and establishing and managing against interim quantitative objectives over time.

Selected process and product measures are incorporated into the organization’s measurement repository to support process-performance analysis and future fact-based decision making.

Subpractices

1.    Statistically manage the performance of one or more subprocesses that are critical contributors to the overall performance of the process.

2.    Predict the ability of the process to achieve its established quantitative objectives considering the performance of the statistically managed subprocesses.

3.    Incorporate selected process-performance measurements into the organization’s process-performance baselines.
GG 5            Institutionalize an Optimizing Process

The process is institutionalized as an optimizing process.

GP 5.1         Ensure Continuous Process Improvement

Ensure continuous improvement of the process in fulfilling the relevant business objectives of the organization.

The purpose of this generic practice is to select and systematically deploy process and technology improvements that contribute to meeting established quality and process-performance objectives.

Refer to the Organizational Innovation and Deployment process area for information about selecting and deploying incremental and innovative improvements that measurably improve the organization's processes and technologies.

Optimizing the processes that are agile and innovative depends on the participation of an empowered workforce aligned with the business values and objectives of the organization. The organization’s ability to rapidly respond to changes and opportunities is enhanced by finding ways to accelerate and share learning. Improvement of the processes is inherently part of everybody’s role, resulting in a cycle of continual improvement.

Subpractices

1.    Establish and maintain quantitative process improvement objectives that support the organization’s business objectives.

The quantitative process improvement objectives may be specific to the individual process or they may be defined for a broader scope (i.e., for a set of processes), with the individual processes contributing to achieving these objectives. Objectives that are specific to the individual process are typically allocated from quantitative objectives established for a broader scope.

These process improvement objectives are primarily derived from the organization’s business objectives and from a detailed understanding of process capability. These objectives are the criteria used to judge whether the process performance is quantitatively improving the organization’s ability to meet its business objectives. These process improvement objectives are often set to values beyond the current process performance, and both incremental and innovative technological improvements may be needed to achieve these objectives. These objectives may also be revised frequently to continue to drive the improvement of the process (i.e., when an objective is achieved, it may be set to a new value that is again beyond the new process performance).

These process improvement objectives may be the same as, or a refinement of, the objectives established in the “Establish Quantitative Objectives for the Process” generic practice, as long as they can serve as both drivers and criteria for successful process improvement.

2.    Identify process improvements that would result in measurable improvements to process performance.

Process improvements include both incremental changes and innovative technological improvements. The innovative technological improvements are typically pursued as efforts that are separately planned, performed, and managed. Piloting is often performed. These efforts often address specific areas of the processes that are determined by analyzing process performance and identifying specific opportunities for significant measurable improvement.

3.    Define strategies and manage deployment of selected process improvements based on the quantified expected benefits, the estimated costs and impacts, and the measured change to process performance.

The costs and benefits of these improvements are estimated quantitatively, and the actual costs and benefits are measured. Benefits are primarily considered relative to the organization’s quantitative process improvement objectives. Improvements are made to both the organization’s set of standard processes and the defined processes.

Managing deployment of the process improvements includes piloting changes and implementing adjustments where appropriate, addressing potential and real barriers to deployment, minimizing disruption to ongoing efforts, and managing risks.
GP 5.2         Correct Root Causes of Problems

Identify and correct the root causes of defects and other problems in the process.

The purpose of this generic practice is to analyze defects and other problems that were encountered in a quantitatively managed process, to correct the root causes of these types of defects and problems, and to prevent these defects and problems from occurring in the future.

Refer to the Causal Analysis and Resolution process area for more information about identifying and correcting root causes of selected defects. Even though the Causal Analysis and Resolution process area has a project context, it can be applied to processes in other contexts as well.

Root cause analysis can be applied beneficially to processes that are not quantitatively managed. However, the focus of this generic practice is to act on a quantitatively managed process, though the final root causes may be found outside of that process.
[Applying Generic Practices]()

This section helps you to develop a better understanding of the generic practices and provides information for interpreting and applying the generic practices in your organization.

Generic practices are components that are common to all process areas. Think of generic practices as reminders. They serve the purpose of reminding you to do things right, and are expected model components.

For example, when you are achieving the specific goals of the Project Planning process area, you are establishing and maintaining a plan that defines project activities. One of the generic practices that applies to the Project Planning process area is “Establish and maintain the plan for performing the project planning process” (GP 2.2). When applied to this process area, this generic practice reminds you to plan the activities involved in creating the plan for the project.

When you are satisfying the specific goals of the Organizational Training process area, you are developing the skills and knowledge of people in your project and organization so that they can perform their roles effectively and efficiently. When applying the same generic practice (GP 2.2) to the Organizational Training process area, this generic practice reminds you to plan the activities involved in developing the skills and knowledge of people in the organization.
[Process Areas That Support Generic Practices]()

While generic goals and generic practices are the model components that directly address the institutionalization of a process across the organization, many process areas likewise address institutionalization by supporting the implementation of the generic practices. Knowing these relationships will help you effectively implement the generic practices.

Such process areas contain one or more specific practices that when implemented may also fully implement a generic practice or generate a work product that is used in the implementation of a generic practice.

An example is the Configuration Management process area and GP 2.6, “Place designated work products of the process under appropriate levels of control.” To implement the generic practice for one or more process areas, you might choose to implement the Configuration Management process area, all or in part, to implement the generic practice.

Another example is the Organizational Process Definition process area and GP 3.1, “Establish and maintain the description of a defined process.” To implement this generic practice for one or more process areas, you should first implement the Organizational Process Definition process area, all or in part, to establish the organizational process assets that are needed to implement the generic practice.

Table 6.2 describes (1) the process areas that support the implementation of generic practices, and (2) the recursive relationships between generic practices and their closely related process areas. Both types of relationships are important to remember during process improvement to take advantage of the natural synergies that exist between the generic practices and their related process areas.

Given the dependencies that generic practices have on these process areas, and given the more “holistic” view that many of these process areas provide, these process areas are often implemented early, in whole or in part, before or concurrent with implementing the associated generic practices.

There are also a few situations where the result of applying a generic practice to a particular process area would seem to make a whole process area redundant, but, in fact, it does not. It may be natural to think that applying GP 3.1, Establish a Defined Process, to the Project Planning and Project Monitoring and Control process areas gives the same effect as the first specific goal of Integrated Project Management, “The project is conducted using a defined process that is tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes.”

Although it is true that there is some overlap, the application of the generic practice to these two process areas provides defined processes covering project planning and project monitoring and control activities. These defined processes do not necessarily cover support activities (such as configuration management), other project management processes (such as supplier agreement management), or the engineering processes. In contrast, the project’s defined process, provided by the Integrated Project Management process area, covers all appropriate project management, engineering, and support processes.
[Causal Analysis and Resolution]()

A Support Process Area at Maturity Level 5

[]()[]()Purpose

The purpose of Causal Analysis and Resolution (CAR) is to identify causes of defects and other problems and take action to prevent them from occurring in the future.

Introductory Notes

The Causal Analysis and Resolution process area involves the following:

·         Identifying and analyzing causes of defects and other problems

·         Taking specific actions to remove the causes and prevent the occurrence of those types of defects and problems in the future

Causal analysis and resolution improves quality and productivity by preventing the introduction of defects into a product. Reliance on detecting defects after they have been introduced is not cost effective. It is more effective to prevent defects from being introduced by integrating causal analysis and resolution activities into each phase of the project.

Since defects and problems may have been previously encountered on other projects or in earlier phases or tasks of the current project, causal analysis and resolution activities are a mechanism for communicating lessons learned among projects.

The types of defects and other problems encountered are analyzed to identify any trends. Based on an understanding of the defined process and how it is implemented, the root causes of the defects and the future implications of the defects are determined.

Causal analysis may also be performed on problems unrelated to defects. For example, causal analysis may be used to improve quality attributes such as cycle time. Improvement proposals, simulations, dynamic systems models, engineering analyses, new business directives, or other items may initiate such analysis.

When it is impractical to perform causal analysis on all defects, defect targets are selected by tradeoffs on estimated investments and estimated returns of quality, productivity and cycle time.

A measurement process should already be in place. The defined measures can be used, though in some instances new measures may be needed to analyze the effects of the process change.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for more information about establishing objectives for measurement and analysis, specifying the measures and analyses to be performed, obtaining and analyzing measures, and reporting results.

Causal Analysis and Resolution activities provide a mechanism for projects to evaluate their processes at the local level and look for improvements that can be implemented.

When improvements are judged to be effective, the information is extended to the organizational level.

Refer to the Organizational Innovation and Deployment process area for more information about improving organizational level processes through proposed improvements and action proposals.

The informative material in this process area is written with the assumption that the specific practices are applied to a quantitatively managed process. The specific practices of this process area may be applicable, but with reduced value, if this assumption is not met.

See the definitions of “stable process” and “common cause of process variation” in the glossary.

Root causes of defects and other problems are systematically determined.

A root cause is a source of a defect such that, if it is removed, the defect is decreased or removed.
SP 1.1         Select Defect Data for Analysis

Select the defects and other problems for analysis.

Typical Work Products

1.    Defect and problem data selected for further analysis

Subpractices

1.    Gather relevant defect or problem data.
Examples of relevant defect data may include the following:

·       Defects reported by the customer

·       Defects reported by end users

·       Defects found in peer reviews

·       Defects found in testing

 

Examples of relevant problem data may include the following:

·       Project management problem reports requiring corrective action

·       Process capability problems

·       Process duration measurements

·       Earned value measurements by process (e.g., cost performance index)

·       Resource throughput, utilization, or response time measurements

 

Refer to the Verification process area for more information about work product verification.

Refer to the Quantitative Project Management process area for more information about statistical management.

2.    Determine which defects and other problems will be analyzed further.

When determining which defects to analyze further, consider the impact of the defects, their frequency of occurrence, the similarity between defects, the cost of analysis, the time and resources needed, the safety considerations, etc.
Examples of methods for selecting defects and other problems include the following:

·       Pareto analysis

·       Histograms

·       Process capability analysis

 

SP 1.2         Analyze Causes

Perform causal analysis of selected defects and other problems and propose actions to address them.

The purpose of this analysis is to develop solutions to the identified problems by analyzing the relevant data and producing action proposals for implementation.

Typical Work Products

1.    Action proposal

Subpractices

1.    Conduct causal analysis with the people who are responsible for performing the task.

Causal analysis is performed, typically in meetings, with those people who have an understanding of the selected defect or problem under study. The people who have the best understanding of the selected defect are typically those responsible for performing the task.
Examples of when to perform causal analysis include the following:

·       When a stable process does not meet its specified quality and process-performance objectives

·       During the task, if and when problems warrant a causal analysis meeting

·       When a work product exhibits an unexpected deviation from its requirements

 

Refer to the Quantitative Project Management process area for more information about achieving the project’s quality and process-performance objectives.

2.    Analyze selected defects and other problems to determine their root causes.

Depending on the type and number of defects, it may make sense to first group the defects before identifying their root causes.
Examples of methods to determine root causes include the following:

·       Cause-and-effect (fishbone) diagrams

·       Check sheets

 

3.    Group the selected defects and other problems based on their root causes.
Examples of cause groups, or categories, include the following:

·       Inadequate training

·       Breakdown of communications

·       Not accounting for all details of a task

·       Making mistakes in manual procedures (e.g., typing)

·       Process deficiency

 

4.    Propose and document actions that need to be taken to prevent the future occurrence of similar defects or other problems.
Examples of proposed actions include changes to the following:

·       The process in question

·       Training

·       Tools

·       Methods

·       Communications

·       Work products

 

Examples of specific actions include the following:

·       Providing training in common problems and techniques for preventing them

·       Changing a process so that error-prone steps do not occur

·       Automating all or part of a process

·       Reordering process activities

·       Adding process steps to prevent defects, such as task kickoff meetings to review common defects and actions to prevent them

 

An action proposal usually documents the following:

·       Originator of the action proposal

·       Description of the problem

·       Description of the defect cause

·       Defect cause category

·       Phase when the problem was introduced

·       Phase when the defect was identified

·       Description of the action proposal

·       Action proposal category
SG 2            Address Causes of Defects

Root causes of defects and other problems are systematically addressed to prevent their future occurrence.

Projects operating according to a well-defined process will systematically analyze the operation where problems still occur and implement process changes to eliminate root causes of selected problems.
SP 2.1         Implement the Action Proposals

Implement the selected action proposals that were developed in causal analysis.

Action proposals describe the tasks necessary to remove the root causes of the analyzed defects or problems and avoid their reoccurrence.

Only changes that prove to be of value should be considered for broad implementation.

Typical Work Products

1.    Action proposals selected for implementation

2.    Improvement proposals

Subpractices

1.    Analyze the action proposals and determine their priorities.

Criteria for prioritizing action proposals include the following:

·       Implications of not addressing the defects

·       Cost to implement process improvements to prevent the defects

·       Expected impact on quality

2.    Select the action proposals that will be implemented.

3.    Create action items for implementing the action proposals.
Examples of information provided in an action item include the following:

·       Person responsible for implementing it

·       Description of the areas affected by it

·       People who are to be kept informed of its status

·       Next date that status will be reviewed

·       Rationale for key decisions

·       Description of implementation actions

·       Time and cost for identifying the defect and correcting it

·       Estimated cost of not fixing the problem

 

To implement the action proposals, the following tasks must be done:

·       Make assignments

·       Coordinate the persons doing the work

·       Review the results

·       Track the action items to closure

Experiments may be conducted for particularly complex changes.
Examples of experiments include the following:

·       Using a temporarily modified process

·       Using a new tool

 

Action items may be assigned to members of the causal analysis team, members of the project team, or other members of the organization.

4.    Identify and remove similar defects that may exist in other processes and work products.

5.    Identify and document improvement proposals for the organization’s set of standard processes.

Refer to the Organizational Innovation and Deployment process area for more information about the selection and deployment of improvement proposals for the organization’s set of standard processes.
SP 2.2         Evaluate the Effect of Changes

Evaluate the effect of changes on process performance.

Refer to the Quantitative Project Management process area for more information about analyzing process performance and creating process capability measures for selected processes.

Once the changed process is deployed across the project, the effect of the changes must be checked to gather evidence that the process change has corrected the problem and improved performance.

Typical Work Products

1.    Measures of performance and performance change

Subpractices

1.    Measure the change in the performance of the project's defined process as appropriate.

This subpractice determines whether the selected change has positively influenced the process performance and by how much.
An example of a change in the performance of the project’s defined design process would be the change in the defect density of the design documentation, as statistically measured through peer reviews before and after the improvement has been made. On a statistical process control chart, this would be represented by a change in the mean.

 

2.    Measure the capability of the project's defined process as appropriate.

This subpractice determines whether the selected change has positively influenced the ability of the process to meet its quality and process-performance objectives, as determined by relevant stakeholders.
An example of a change in the capability of the project’s defined design process would be a change in the ability of the process to stay within its process-specification boundaries. This can be statistically measured by calculating the range of the defect density of design documentation, as collected in peer reviews before and after the improvement has been made. On a statistical process control chart, this would be represented by lowered control limits.

 

SP 2.3         Record Data

Record causal analysis and resolution data for use across the project and organization.

Data are recorded so that other projects and organizations can make appropriate process changes and achieve similar results.

Record the following:

·         Data on defects and other problems that were analyzed

·         Rationale for decisions

·         Action proposals from causal analysis meetings

·         Action items resulting from action proposals

·         Cost of the analysis and resolution activities

·         Measures of changes to the performance of the defined process resulting from resolutions

[Configuration Management]()

A Support Process Area at Maturity Level 2

Purpose

The purpose of Configuration Management (CM) is to establish and maintain the integrity of work products using configuration identification, configuration control, configuration status accounting, and configuration audits.

Introductory Notes

The Configuration Management process area involves the following:

·         Identifying the configuration of selected work products that compose the baselines at given points in time

·         Controlling changes to configuration items

·         Building or providing specifications to build work products from the configuration management system

·         Maintaining the integrity of baselines

·         Providing accurate status and current configuration data to developers, end users, and customers

The work products placed under configuration management include the products that are delivered to the customer, designated internal work products, acquired products, tools, and other items that are used in creating and describing these work products. (See the definition of “configuration management” in the glossary.)

Acquired products may need to be placed under configuration management by both the supplier and the project. Provisions for conducting configuration management should be established in supplier agreements. Methods to ensure that the data is complete and consistent should be established and maintained.

Refer to the Supplier Agreement Management process area for more information about establishing and maintaining agreements with suppliers.
Examples of work products that may be placed under configuration management include the following:

·         Plans

·         Process descriptions

·         Requirements

·         Design data

·         Drawings

·         Product specifications

·         Code

·         Compilers

·         Product data files

·         Product technical publications

 

Configuration management of work products may be performed at several levels of granularity. Configuration items can be decomposed into configuration components and configuration units. Only the term “configuration item” is used in this process area. Therefore, in these practices, “configuration item” may be interpreted as “configuration component” or “configuration unit” as appropriate. (See the definition of “configuration item” in the glossary.)

Baselines provide a stable basis for continuing evolution of configuration items.
An example of a baseline is an approved description of a product that includes internally consistent versions of requirements, requirement traceability matrices, design, discipline-specific items, and end-user documentation.

 

Baselines are added to the configuration management system as they are developed. Changes to baselines and the release of work products built from the configuration management system are systematically controlled and monitored via the configuration control, change management, and configuration auditing functions of configuration management.

This process area applies not only to configuration management on projects, but also to configuration management on organizational work products such as standards, procedures, and reuse libraries.

Configuration management is focused on the rigorous control of the managerial and technical aspects of work products, including the delivered system.

This process area covers the practices for performing the configuration management function and is applicable to all work products that are placed under configuration management.
Related Process Areas

Refer to the Project Planning process area for information on developing plans and work breakdown structures, which may be useful for determining configuration items.

Refer to the Project Monitoring and Control process area for more information about performance analyses and corrective actions.

SG 1 Establish Baselines

SP 1.1       Identify Configuration Items

SP 1.2       Establish a Configuration Management System

SP 1.3       Create or Release Baselines

SG 2 Track and Control Changes

SP 2.1       Track Change Requests

SP 2.2       Control Configuration Items

SG 3 Establish Integrity

SP 3.1       Establish Configuration Management Records

SP 3.2       Perform Configuration Audits

 
Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Establish Baselines

Baselines of identified work products are established.

Specific practices to establish baselines are covered by this specific goal. The specific practices under the Track and Control Changes specific goal serve to maintain the baselines. The specific practices of the Establish Integrity specific goal document and audit the integrity of the baselines.
SP 1.1         Identify Configuration Items

Identify the configuration items, components, and related work products that will be placed under configuration management.

Configuration identification is the selection, creation, and specification of the following:

·         Products that are delivered to the customer

·         Designated internal work products

·         Acquired products

·         Tools and other capital assets of the project's work environment

·         Other items that are used in creating and describing these work products

Items under configuration management will include specifications and interface documents that define the requirements for the product. Other documents, such as test results, may also be included, depending on their criticality to defining the product.

A “configuration item” is an entity designated for configuration management, which may consist of multiple related work products that form a baseline. This logical grouping provides ease of identification and controlled access. The selection of work products for configuration management should be based on criteria established during planning.

Typical Work Products

1.    Identified configuration items

Subpractices

1.    Select the configuration items and the work products that compose them based on documented criteria.
Example criteria for selecting configuration items at the appropriate work product level include the following:

·       Work products that may be used by two or more groups

·       Work products that are expected to change over time either because of errors or change of requirements

·       Work products that are dependent on each other in that a change in one mandates a change in the others

·       Work products that are critical for the project

 

Examples of work products that may be part of a configuration item include the following:

·       Process descriptions

·       Requirements

·       Design

·       Test plans and procedures

·       Test results

·       Interface descriptions

·       Drawings

·       Source code

·       Tools (e.g., compilers)

 

2.    Assign unique identifiers to configuration items.

3.    Specify the important characteristics of each configuration item.
Example characteristics of configuration items include author, document or file type, and programming language for software code files.

 

4.    Specify when each configuration item is placed under configuration management.
Example criteria for determining when to place work products under configuration management include the following:

·       Stage of the project lifecycle

·       When the work product is ready for test

·       Degree of control desired on the work product

·       Cost and schedule limitations

·       Customer requirements

 

5.    Identify the owner responsible for each configuration item.
SP 1.2         Establish a Configuration Management System

Establish and maintain a configuration management and change management system for controlling work products.

A configuration management system includes the storage media, the procedures, and the tools for accessing the configuration system.

A change management system includes the storage media, the procedures, and tools for recording and accessing change requests.

Typical Work Products

1.    Configuration management system with controlled work products

2.    Configuration management system access control procedures

3.    Change request database

Subpractices

1.    Establish a mechanism to manage multiple control levels of configuration management.

The level of control is typically selected based on project objectives, risk, and/or resources. Control levels may vary in relation to the project lifecycle, type of system under development, and specific project requirements.
Example levels of control include the following:

·       Create – controlled by author

·       Engineering – notification to relevant stakeholders when changes are made

·       Development – lower level CCB control

·       Formal – higher level CCB control with customer involvement

 

Levels of control can range from informal control that simply tracks changes made when the configuration items are being developed to formal configuration control using baselines that can only be changed as part of a formal configuration management process.

2.    Store and retrieve configuration items in a configuration management system.
Examples of configuration management systems include the following:

·       Dynamic (or author’s) systems contain components currently being created or revised. They are in the author’s workspace and are controlled by the author. Configuration items in a dynamic system are under version control.

·       Master (or controlled) systems contain current baselines and changes to them. Configuration items in a master system are under full configuration management as described in this process area.

·       Static systems contain archives of various baselines released for use. Static systems are under full configuration management as described in this process area.

 

3.    Share and transfer configuration items between control levels within the configuration management system.

4.    Store and recover archived versions of configuration items.

5.    Store, update, and retrieve configuration management records.

6.    Create configuration management reports from the configuration management system.

7.    Preserve the contents of the configuration management system.
Examples of preservation functions of the configuration management system include the following:

·       Backups and restoration of configuration management files

·       Archiving of configuration management files

·       Recovery from configuration management errors

 

8.    Revise the configuration management structure as necessary.
SP 1.3         Create or Release Baselines

Create or release baselines for internal use and for delivery to the customer.

A baseline is a set of specifications or work products that has been formally reviewed and agreed on, that thereafter serves as the basis for further development or delivery, and that can be changed only through change control procedures. A baseline represents the assignment of an identifier to a configuration item or a collection of configuration items and associated entities. As a product evolves, several baselines may be used to control its development and testing.

 

For Systems Engineering

One common set of baselines includes the system-level requirements, system-element-level design requirements, and the product definition at the end of development/beginning of production. These are typically referred to as the “functional baseline,” “allocated baseline,” and “product baseline.”

 

 

For Software Engineering

A software baseline can be a set of requirements, design, source code files and the associated executable code, build files, and user documentation (associated entities) that have been assigned a unique identifier.

 

Typical Work Products

1.    Baselines

2.    Description of baselines

Subpractices

1.    Obtain authorization from the configuration control board (CCB) before creating or releasing baselines of configuration items.

2.    Create or release baselines only from configuration items in the configuration management system.

3.    Document the set of configuration items that are contained in a baseline.

4.    Make the current set of baselines readily available.
SG 2            Track and Control Changes

Changes to the work products under configuration management are tracked and controlled.

The specific practices under this specific goal serve to maintain the baselines after they are established by the specific practices under the Establish Baselines specific goal.
SP 2.1         Track Change Requests

Track change requests for the configuration items.

Change requests address not only new or changed requirements, but also failures and defects in the work products.

Change requests are analyzed to determine the impact that the change will have on the work product, related work products, budget, and schedule.

Typical Work Products

1.    Change requests

Subpractices

1.    Initiate and record change requests in the change request database.

2.    Analyze the impact of changes and fixes proposed in the change requests.

Changes are evaluated through activities that ensure that they are consistent with all technical and project requirements.

Changes are evaluated for their impact beyond immediate project or contract requirements. Changes to an item used in multiple products can resolve an immediate issue while causing a problem in other applications.

3.    Review change requests that will be addressed in the next baseline with the relevant stakeholders and get their agreement.

Conduct the change request review with appropriate participants. Record the disposition of each change request and the rationale for the decision, including success criteria, a brief action plan if appropriate, and needs met or unmet by the change. Perform the actions required in the disposition, and report the results to relevant stakeholders.

4.    Track the status of change requests to closure.

Change requests brought into the system need to be handled in an efficient and timely manner. Once a change request has been processed, it is critical to close the request with the appropriate approved action as soon as it is practical. Actions left open result in larger than necessary status lists, which in turn result in added costs and confusion.
SP 2.2         Control Configuration Items

Control changes to the configuration items.

Control is maintained over the configuration of the work product baseline. This control includes tracking the configuration of each of the configuration items, approving a new configuration if necessary, and updating the baseline.

Typical Work Products

1.    Revision history of configuration items

2.    Archives of the baselines

Subpractices

1.    Control changes to configuration items throughout the life of the product.

2.    Obtain appropriate authorization before changed configuration items are entered into the configuration management system.
For example, authorization may come from the CCB, the project manager, or the customer.

 

3.    Check in and check out configuration items from the configuration management system for incorporation of changes in a manner that maintains the correctness and integrity of the configuration items.
Examples of check-in and check-out steps include the following:

·       Confirming that the revisions are authorized

·       Updating the configuration items

·       Archiving the replaced baseline and retrieving the new baseline

 

4.    Perform reviews to ensure that changes have not caused unintended effects on the baselines (e.g., ensure that the changes have not compromised the safety and/or security of the system).

5.    Record changes to configuration items and the reasons for the changes as appropriate.

If a proposed change to the work product is accepted, a schedule is identified for incorporating the change into the work product and other affected areas.

Configuration control mechanisms can be tailored to categories of changes. For example, the approval considerations could be less stringent for component changes that do not affect other components.

Changed configuration items are released after review and approval of configuration changes. Changes are not official until they are released.
SG 3            Establish Integrity

Integrity of baselines is established and maintained.

The integrity of the baselines, established by processes associated with the Establish Baselines specific goal, and maintained by processes associated with the Track and Control Changes specific goal, is provided by the specific practices under this specific goal.
SP 3.1         Establish Configuration Management Records

Establish and maintain records describing configuration items.

Typical Work Products

1.    Revision history of configuration items

2.    Change log

3.    Copy of the change requests

4.    Status of configuration items

5.    Differences between baselines

Subpractices

1.    Record configuration management actions in sufficient detail so the content and status of each configuration item is known and previous versions can be recovered.

2.    Ensure that relevant stakeholders have access to and knowledge of the configuration status of the configuration items.
Examples of activities for communicating configuration status include the following:

·       Providing access permissions to authorized end users

·       Making baseline copies readily available to authorized end users

 

3.    Specify the latest version of the baselines.

4.    Identify the version of configuration items that constitute a particular baseline.

5.    Describe the differences between successive baselines.

6.    Revise the status and history (i.e., changes and other actions) of each configuration item as necessary.
SP 3.2         Perform Configuration Audits

Perform configuration audits to maintain integrity of the configuration baselines.

Configuration audits confirm that the resulting baselines and documentation conform to a specified standard or requirement. Audit results should be recorded as appropriate. (See the glossary for a definition of “configuration audit.”)
Examples of audit types include the following:

·         Functional Configuration Audits (FCA) – Audits conducted to verify that the as-tested functional characteristics of a configuration item have achieved the requirements specified in its functional baseline documentation and that the operational and support documentation is complete and satisfactory.

·         Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) – Audits conducted to verify that the as-built configuration item conforms to the technical documentation that defines it.

·         Configuration management audits – Audits conducted to confirm that configuration management records and configuration items are complete, consistent, and accurate.

 

Typical Work Products

1.    Configuration audit results

2.    Action items

Subpractices

1.    Assess the integrity of the baselines.

2.    Confirm that the configuration management records correctly identify the configuration items.

3.    Review the structure and integrity of the items in the configuration management system.

4.    Confirm the completeness and correctness of the items in the configuration management system.

Completeness and correctness of the content is based on the requirements as stated in the plan and the disposition of approved change requests.

5.    Confirm compliance with applicable configuration management standards and procedures.

6.    Track action items from the audit to closure.

[Decision Analysis and Resolution]()

A Support Process Area at Maturity Level 3

Purpose

The purpose of Decision Analysis and Resolution (DAR) is to analyze possible decisions using a formal evaluation process that evaluates identified alternatives against established criteria.

Introductory Notes

The Decision Analysis and Resolution process area involves establishing guidelines to determine which issues should be subjected to a formal evaluation process and then applying formal evaluation processes to these issues.

A formal evaluation process is a structured approach to evaluating alternative solutions against established criteria to determine a recommended solution to address an issue. A formal evaluation process involves the following actions:

·         Establishing the criteria for evaluating alternatives

·         Identifying alternative solutions

·         Selecting methods for evaluating alternatives

·         Evaluating the alternative solutions using the established criteria and methods

·         Selecting recommended solutions from the alternatives based on the evaluation criteria

Rather than using the phrase “alternative solutions to address issues” each time it is needed, we will use one of two shorter phrases: “alternative solutions” or “alternatives.”

A formal evaluation process reduces the subjective nature of the decision and has a higher probability of selecting a solution that meets the multiple demands of relevant stakeholders.

While the primary application of this process area is to technical concerns, formal evaluation processes can also be applied to many nontechnical issues, particularly when a project is being planned. Issues that have multiple alternative solutions and evaluation criteria lend themselves to a formal evaluation process.
Trade studies of equipment or software are typical examples of formal evaluation processes.

 

During planning, specific issues requiring a formal evaluation process are identified. Typical issues include selection among architectural or design alternatives, use of reusable or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, supplier selection, engineering support environments or associated tools, test environments, delivery alternatives, and logistics and production. A formal evaluation process can also be used to address a make-or-buy decision, the development of manufacturing processes, the selection of distribution locations, and other decisions.

Guidelines are created for deciding when to use formal evaluation processes to address unplanned issues. Guidelines often suggest using formal evaluation processes when issues are associated with medium to high risks or when issues affect the ability to achieve project objectives.

Formal evaluation processes can vary in formality, type of criteria, and methods employed. Less formal decisions can be analyzed in a few hours, use only a few criteria (e.g., effectiveness and cost to implement), and result in a one- or two-page report. More formal decisions may require separate plans, months of effort, meetings to develop and approve criteria, simulations, prototypes, piloting, and extensive documentation.

Both numeric and non-numeric criteria can be used in a formal evaluation process. Numeric criteria use weights to reflect the relative importance of the criteria. Non-numeric criteria use a more subjective ranking scale (e.g., high, medium, or low). More formal decisions may require a full trade study.

A formal evaluation process identifies and evaluates alternative solutions. The eventual selection of a solution may involve iterative activities of identification and evaluation. Portions of identified alternatives may be combined, emerging technologies may change alternatives, and the business situation of vendors may change during the evaluation period.

A recommended alternative is accompanied by documentation of the selected methods, criteria, alternatives, and rationale for the recommendation. The documentation is distributed to relevant stakeholders; it provides a record of the formal evaluation process and rationale that are useful to other projects that encounter a similar issue.

While some of the decisions made throughout the life of the project involve the use of a formal evaluation process, others do not. As mentioned earlier, guidelines should be established to determine which issues should be subjected to a formal evaluation process.
Related Process Areas

Refer to the Project Planning process area for more information about general planning for projects.

Refer to the Integrated Project Management process area for more information about establishing the project’s defined process. The project’s defined process includes a formal evaluation process for each selected issue and incorporates the use of guidelines for applying a formal evaluation process to unforeseen issues.

Refer to the Risk Management process area for more information about identifying and mitigating risks. A formal evaluation process is often used to address issues with identified medium or high risks. Selected solutions typically affect risk mitigation plans.

Specific Goal and Practice Summary

SG 1 Evaluate Alternatives

SP 1.1       Establish Guidelines for Decision Analysis

SP 1.2       Establish Evaluation Criteria

SP 1.3       Identify Alternative Solutions

SP 1.4       Select Evaluation Methods

SP 1.5       Evaluate Alternatives

SP 1.6       Select Solutions

 
Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Evaluate Alternatives

Decisions are based on an evaluation of alternatives using established criteria.

Issues requiring a formal evaluation process may be identified at any time. The objective should be to identify issues as early as possible to maximize the time available to resolve them.
SP 1.1         Establish Guidelines for Decision Analysis

Establish and maintain guidelines to determine which issues are subject to a formal evaluation process.

Not every decision is significant enough to require a formal evaluation process. The choice between the trivial and the truly important will be unclear without explicit guidance. Whether a decision is significant or not is dependent on the project and circumstances, and is determined by the established guidelines.

Typical guidelines for determining when to require a formal evaluation process include the following:

·         When a decision is directly related to topics assessed as being of medium or high risk

·         When a decision is related to changing work products under configuration management

·         When a decision would cause schedule delays over a certain percentage or specific amount of time

·         When a decision affects the ability to achieve project objectives

·         When the costs of the formal evaluation process are reasonable when compared to the decision’s impact

·         When a legal obligation exists during a solicitation

Refer to the Risk Management process area for more information about determining which issues are medium or high risk.
Examples of when to use a formal evaluation process include the following:

·         On decisions involving the procurement of material when 20 percent of the material parts constitute 80 percent of the total material costs

·         On design-implementation decisions when technical performance failure may cause a catastrophic failure (e.g., safety of flight item)

·         On decisions with the potential to significantly reduce design risk, engineering changes, cycle time, response time, and production costs (e.g., to use lithography models to assess form and fit capability before releasing engineering drawings and production builds)

 

Typical Work Products

1.    Guidelines for when to apply a formal evaluation process

Subpractices

1.    Establish guidelines.

2.    Incorporate the use of the guidelines into the defined process where appropriate.

Refer to the Integrated Project Management process area for more information about establishing the project’s defined process.
SP 1.2         Establish Evaluation Criteria

Establish and maintain the criteria for evaluating alternatives, and the relative ranking of these criteria.

The evaluation criteria provide the basis for evaluating alternative solutions. The criteria are ranked so that the highest ranked criteria exert the most influence on the evaluation.

This process area is referenced by many other process areas in the model, and there are many contexts in which a formal evaluation process can be used. Therefore, in some situations you may find that criteria have already been defined as part of another process. This specific practice does not suggest that a second development of criteria be conducted.

Document the evaluation criteria to minimize the possibility that decisions will be second-guessed, or that the reason for making the decision will be forgotten. Decisions based on criteria that are explicitly defined and established remove barriers to stakeholder buy-in.

Typical Work Products

1.    Documented evaluation criteria

2.    Rankings of criteria importance

Subpractices

1.    Define the criteria for evaluating alternative solutions.

Criteria should be traceable to requirements, scenarios, business case assumptions, business objectives, or other documented sources. Types of criteria to consider include the following:

·       Technology limitations

·       Environmental impact

·       Risks

·       Total ownership and lifecycle costs

2.    Define the range and scale for ranking the evaluation criteria.

Scales of relative importance for evaluation criteria can be established with non-numeric values or with formulas that relate the evaluation parameter to a numeric weight.

3.    Rank the criteria.

The criteria are ranked according to the defined range and scale to reflect the needs, objectives, and priorities of the relevant stakeholders.

4.    Assess the criteria and their relative importance.

5.    Evolve the evaluation criteria to improve their validity.

6.    Document the rationale for the selection and rejection of evaluation criteria.

Documentation of selection criteria and rationale may be needed to justify solutions or for future reference and use.
SP 1.3         Identify Alternative Solutions

Identify alternative solutions to address issues.

A wider range of alternatives can surface by soliciting as many stakeholders as practical for input. Input from stakeholders with diverse skills and backgrounds can help teams identify and address assumptions, constraints, and biases. Brainstorming sessions may stimulate innovative alternatives through rapid interaction and feedback. Sufficient candidate solutions may not be furnished for analysis. As the analysis proceeds, other alternatives should be added to the list of potential candidate solutions. The generation and consideration of multiple alternatives early in a decision analysis and resolution process increases the likelihood that an acceptable decision will be made, and that consequences of the decision will be understood.

Typical Work Products

1.    Identified alternatives

Subpractices

1.    Perform a literature search.

A literature search can uncover what others have done both inside and outside the organization. It may provide a deeper understanding of the problem, alternatives to consider, barriers to implementation, existing trade studies, and lessons learned from similar decisions.

2.    Identify alternatives for consideration in addition to those that may be provided with the issue.

Evaluation criteria are an effective starting point for identifying alternatives. The evaluation criteria identify the priorities of the relevant stakeholders and the importance of technical, logistical, or other challenges.

Combining key attributes of existing alternatives can generate additional and sometimes stronger alternatives.

Solicit alternatives from relevant stakeholders. Brainstorming sessions, interviews, and working groups can be used effectively to uncover alternatives.

3.    Document the proposed alternatives.
SP 1.4         Select Evaluation Methods

Select the evaluation methods.

Methods for evaluating alternative solutions against established criteria can range from simulations to the use of probabilistic models and decision theory. These methods need to be carefully selected. The level of detail of a method should be commensurate with cost, schedule, performance, and risk impacts.

While many problems may need only one evaluation method, some problems may require multiple methods. For instance, simulations may augment a trade study to determine which design alternative best meets a given criterion.

Typical Work Products

1.    Selected evaluation methods

Subpractices

1.    Select the methods based on the purpose for analyzing a decision and on the availability of the information used to support the method.
For example, the methods used for evaluating a solution when requirements are weakly defined may be different from the methods used when the requirements are well defined.

 

Typical evaluation methods include the following:

·       Modeling and simulation

·       Engineering studies

·       Manufacturing studies

·       Cost studies

·       Business opportunity studies

·       Surveys

·       Extrapolations based on field experience and prototypes

·       User review and comment

·       Testing

·       Judgment provided by an expert or group of experts (e.g., Delphi Method)

2.    Select evaluation methods based on their ability to focus on the issues at hand without being overly influenced by side issues.

Results of simulations can be skewed by random activities in the solution that are not directly related to the issues at hand.

3.    Determine the measures needed to support the evaluation method.

Consider the impact on cost, schedule, performance, and risks.
SP 1.5         Evaluate Alternatives

Evaluate alternative solutions using the established criteria and methods.

Evaluating alternative solutions involves analysis, discussion, and review. Iterative cycles of analysis are sometimes necessary. Supporting analyses, experimentation, prototyping, piloting, or simulations may be needed to substantiate scoring and conclusions.

Often, the relative importance of criteria is imprecise and the total effect on a solution is not apparent until after the analysis is performed. In cases where the resulting scores differ by relatively small amounts, the best selection among alternative solutions may not be clear cut. Challenges to criteria and assumptions should be encouraged.

Typical Work Products

1.    Evaluation results

Subpractices

1.    Evaluate the proposed alternative solutions using the established evaluation criteria and selected methods.

2.    Evaluate the assumptions related to the evaluation criteria and the evidence that supports the assumptions.

3.    Evaluate whether uncertainty in the values for alternative solutions affects the evaluation and address as appropriate.

For instance, if the score can vary between two values, is the difference significant enough to make a difference in the final solution set? Does the variation in score represent a high risk? To address these concerns, simulations may be run, further studies may be performed, or evaluation criteria may be modified, among other things.

4.    Perform simulations, modeling, prototypes, and pilots as necessary to exercise the evaluation criteria, methods, and alternative solutions.

Untested criteria, their relative importance, and supporting data or functions may cause the validity of solutions to be questioned. Criteria and their relative priorities and scales can be tested with trial runs against a set of alternatives. These trial runs of a select set of criteria allow for the evaluation of the cumulative impact of the criteria on a solution. If the trials reveal problems, different criteria or alternatives might be considered to avoid biases.

5.    Consider new alternative solutions, criteria, or methods if the proposed alternatives do not test well; repeat the evaluations until alternatives do test well.

6.    Document the results of the evaluation.

Document the rationale for the addition of new alternatives or methods and changes to criteria, as well as the results of interim evaluations.
SP 1.6         Select Solutions

Select solutions from the alternatives based on the evaluation criteria.

Selecting solutions involves weighing the results from the evaluation of alternatives. Risks associated with implementation of the solutions must be assessed.

Typical Work Products

1.    Recommended solutions to address significant issues

Subpractices

1.    Assess the risks associated with implementing the recommended solution.

Refer to the Risk Management process area for more information about identifying and managing risks.

Decisions must often be made with incomplete information. There can be substantial risk associated with the decision because of having incomplete information.

When decisions must be made according to a specific schedule, time and resources may not be available for gathering complete information. Consequently, risky decisions made with incomplete information may require re-analysis later. Identified risks should be monitored.

2.    Document the results and rationale for the recommended solution.

It is important to record both why a solution is selected and why another solution was rejected.

[Integrated Project Management +IPPD]()

A Project Management Process Area at Maturity Level 3

Purpose

The purpose of Integrated Project Management (IPM) is to establish and manage the project and the involvement of the relevant stakeholders according to an integrated and defined process that is tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes.

**IPPD Addition**

For IPPD, Integrated Project Management +IPPD also covers the establishment of a shared vision for the project and the establishment of integrated teams that will carry out objectives of the project.

 

Introductory Notes

Integrated Project Management involves the following:

·         Establishing the project’s defined process at project startup by tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes

·         Managing the project using the project’s defined process

·         Establishing the work environment for the project based on the organization's work environment standards

·         Using and contributing to the organizational process assets

·         Enabling relevant stakeholders’ concerns to be identified, considered, and, when appropriate, addressed during the development of the product

·         Ensuring that the relevant stakeholders perform their tasks in a coordinated and timely manner (1) to address product and product component requirements, plans, objectives, problems, and risks; (2) to fulfill their commitments; and (3) to identify, track, and resolve coordination issues

 
IPPD Addition

Integrated Project Management +IPPD also involves the following:

·       Establishing a shared vision for the project

·       Establishing integrated teams that are tasked to accomplish project objectives

 

The integrated and defined process that is tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes is called the project’s defined process.

Managing the project’s effort, cost, schedule, staffing, risks, and other factors is tied to the tasks of the project’s defined process. The implementation and management of the project’s defined process are typically described in the project plan. Certain activities may be covered in other plans that affect the project, such as the quality assurance plan, risk management strategy, and the configuration management plan.

Since the defined process for each project is tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes, variability among projects is typically reduced and projects can more easily share process assets, data, and lessons learned.

This process area also addresses the coordination of all activities associated with the project such as the following:

·         Development activities (e.g., requirements development, design, and verification)

·         Service activities (e.g., delivery, help desk, operations, and customer contact)

·         Acquisition activities (e.g., solicitation, contract monitoring, and transition to operation)

·         Support activities (e.g., configuration management, documentation, marketing, and training)

The working interfaces and interactions among relevant stakeholders internal and external to the project are planned and managed to ensure the quality and integrity of the entire product. Relevant stakeholders participate, as appropriate, in defining the project’s defined process and the project plan. Reviews and exchanges are regularly conducted with the relevant stakeholders to ensure that coordination issues receive appropriate attention and everyone involved with the project is appropriately aware of the status, plans, and activities. (See the definition of “relevant stakeholder” in the glossary.) In defining the project’s defined process, formal interfaces are created as necessary to ensure that appropriate coordination and collaboration occurs.

This process area applies in any organizational structure, including projects that are structured as line organizations, matrix organizations, or integrated teams. The terminology should be appropriately interpreted for the organizational structure in place.

Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Use the Project’s Defined Process

The project is conducted using a defined process that is tailored from the organization's set of standard processes.

The project’s defined process must include those processes from the organization’s set of standard processes that address all processes necessary to acquire or develop and maintain the product. The product-related lifecycle processes, such as the manufacturing and support processes, are developed concurrently with the product.
SP 1.1         Establish the Project’s Defined Process

Establish and maintain the project's defined process from project startup through the life of the project.

Refer to the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about the organizational process assets.

Refer to the Organizational Process Focus process area for more information about organizational process needs and objectives and deploying the organization’s set of standard processes on projects.

The project’s defined process consists of defined processes that form an integrated, coherent lifecycle for the project.

 
IPPD Addition

The project’s defined process supports IPPD with processes that

·       Make the integrated project management environment more amenable to collocated or distributed teams

·       Select the project's integrated team structure

·       Allocate limited personnel resources

·       Implement cross-integrated team communication

 

The project's defined process should satisfy the project's contractual and operational needs, opportunities, and constraints. It is designed to provide a best fit for the project’s needs. A project's defined process is based on the following factors:

·         Customer requirements

·         Product and product component requirements

·         Commitments

·         Organizational process needs and objectives

·         Organization’s set of standard processes and tailoring guidelines

·         Operational environment

·         Business environment

Establishing the project’s defined process at project startup helps to ensure that project staff and stakeholders implement a set of activities needed to efficiently establish an initial set of requirements and plans for the project. As the project progresses, the description of the project’s defined process is elaborated and revised to better meet the project’s requirements and the organization’s process needs and objectives. Also, as the organization’s set of standard processes change, the project’s defined process may need to be revised.

Typical Work Products

1.    The project’s defined process

Subpractices

1.    Select a lifecycle model from those available from the organizational process assets.
Examples of project characteristics that could affect the selection of lifecycle models include the following:

·       Size of the project

·       Experience and familiarity of staff in implementing the process

·       Constraints such as cycle time and acceptable defect levels

 

2.    Select the standard processes from the organization's set of standard processes that best fit the needs of the project.

3.    Tailor the organization’s set of standard processes and other organizational process assets according to the tailoring guidelines to produce the project’s defined process.

Sometimes the available lifecycle models and standard processes are inadequate to meet a specific project’s needs. Sometimes the project will be unable to produce required work products or measures. In such circumstances, the project will need to seek approval to deviate from what is required by the organization. Waivers are provided for this purpose.

4.    Use other artifacts from the organization's process asset library as appropriate.

Other artifacts may include the following:

·       Lessons-learned documents

·       Templates

·       Example documents

·       Estimating models

5.    Document the project's defined process.

The project's defined process covers all of the activities for the project and its interfaces to relevant stakeholders.
Examples of project activities include the following:

·       Project planning

·       Project monitoring

·       Requirements development

·       Requirements management

·       Supplier management

·       Configuration management

·       Quality assurance

·       Risk management

·       Decision analysis and resolution

·       Product development and support

·       Solicitation

 

6.    Conduct peer reviews of the project's defined process.

Refer to the Verification process area for more information about conducting peer reviews.

7.    Revise the project's defined process as necessary.
SP 1.2         Use Organizational Process Assets for Planning Project Activities

Use the organizational process assets and measurement repository for estimating and planning the project’s activities.

Refer to the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about organizational process assets and the organization’s measurement repository.

Typical Work Products

1.    Project estimates

2.    Project plans

Subpractices

1.    Use the tasks and work products of the project's defined process as a basis for estimating and planning the project's activities.

An understanding of the relationships among the various tasks and work products of the project's defined process, and of the roles to be performed by the relevant stakeholders, is a basis for developing a realistic plan.

2.    Use the organization’s measurement repository in estimating the project’s planning parameters.

This estimate typically includes the following:

·       Using appropriate historical data from this project or similar projects

·       Accounting for and recording similarities and differences between the current project and those projects whose historical data will be used

·       Independently validating the historical data

·       Recording the reasoning, assumptions, and rationale used to select the historical data
Examples of parameters that are considered for similarities and differences include the following:

·       Work product and task attributes

·       Application domain

·       Design approach

·       Operational environment

·       Experience of the people

 

Examples of data contained in the organization’s measurement repository include the following:

·       Size of work products or other work product attributes

·       Effort

·       Cost

·       Schedule

·       Staffing

·       Defects

·       Response time

·       Service capacity

·       Supplier performance

 

SP 1.3         Establish the Project's Work Environment

Establish and maintain the project's work environment based on the organization's work environment standards.

An appropriate work environment for a project comprises an infrastructure of facilities, tools, and equipment that people need to perform their jobs effectively in support of business and project objectives. The work environment and its components are maintained at a level of performance and reliability indicated by the organizational work environment standards. As required, the project’s work environment or some of its components can be developed internally or acquired from external sources.

IPPD Addition SG 3            Apply IPPD Principles

The project is managed using IPPD principles.

The purpose of this specific goal and its practices is to create an IPPD environment that enables integrated teams to efficiently meet the project’s requirements and produce a quality product.
SP 3.1         Establish the Project’s Shared Vision

Establish and maintain a shared vision for the project.

A project does not operate in isolation. Understanding organizational mission, goals, expectations and constraints allows the project to align its direction, activities, and shared vision with the organization and helps create a common purpose within which project activities can be coordinated. To enable this, it is critical to understand the interfaces between the project and stakeholders external to the project and the objectives and expectations of all relevant stakeholders (internal and external).

When creating a shared vision, consider:

·         external stakeholder expectations and requirements

·         the aspirations and expectations of the project leader, team leaders, and team members

·         the project’s objectives

·         the conditions and outcomes the project will create

·         interfaces the project needs to maintain

·         the visions created by interfacing groups

·         the constraints imposed by outside authorities (e.g., environmental regulations)

·         project operation while working to achieve its objectives (both principles and behaviors)

When creating a shared vision, all people in the project should be invited to participate. Although there may be a draft proposal, the larger population must have an opportunity to speak and be heard about what really matters to them. The shared vision is articulated in terms of both the core ideology (values, principles, and behaviors) and the desired future to which each member of the project can commit.

An effective communications strategy is key to implementing and focusing the shared vision throughout the project. Promulgation of the shared vision is a public declaration of the commitment of the project to their shared vision and provides the opportunity for others to examine, understand, and align their activities in a common direction. The shared vision should be communicated, and agreement and commitment of the relevant stakeholders should be obtained.

 

 

Effective communications are also especially important when incorporating new project members. New members of the project often need more or special attention to ensure that they understand the shared vision, have a stake in it, and are prepared to follow it in doing their work.

Typical Work Products

1.    Documented shared vision

2.    Communications strategy

3.    Published principles, shared vision statement, mission statement, and objectives (e.g., posters, wallet cards, and presentations)

3.    Establish a strategy to communicate the project’s shared vision both externally and internally.

4.    Create presentations suitable for the various audiences that need to be informed about the project’s shared vision.

5.    Ensure that project and individual activities and tasks are aligned with the project’s shared vision.
SP 3.2         Establish the Integrated Team Structure

Establish and maintain the integrated team structure for the project.

Product requirements, cost, schedule, risk, resource projections, business processes, the project’s defined process, and organizational guidelines are evaluated to establish the basis for defining integrated teams and their responsibilities, authorities, and interrelationships.

A typical integrated team structure may be based on the product-oriented hierarchy found in the WBS. More complex structuring occurs when the WBS is not product oriented, product risks are not uniform, and resources are constrained.

 

The integrated team structure is a dynamic entity that is adjusted to changes in people, requirements, and the nature of tasks, and to tackle many difficulties. For small projects, the integrated team structure can treat the whole project as an integrated team. The integrated team structure should be continuously monitored to detect malfunctions, mismanaged interfaces, and mismatches of the work to the staff. Corrective action should be taken when performance does not meet expectations.

Refer to the Establish Rules and Guidelines for Integrated Teams specific practice in the Organizational Process Definition +IPPD process area for more information about establishing organizational rules and guidelines for structuring and forming integrated teams.

Typical Work Products

1.    Assessments of the product and product architectures, including risk and complexity

2.    Integrated team structure

Subpractices

1.    Establish an integrated team structure.

An integrated team structure is dependent on:

·       An assessment of product risk and complexity

·       Location and types of risks

·       Integration risks, including product component interfaces and inter-team communication

·       Resources, including availability of appropriately skilled people

·       Limitations on team size for effective collaboration

·       Need for team membership of stakeholders external to the project

·       Business processes

·       Organizational structure

The integrated team structure should be based on an understanding of the project’s defined process and shared vision, the organization’s standard processes, and the organizational process assets applicable to teams and team structures.

2.    Periodically evaluate and modify the integrated team structure to best meet project needs.

Changes to the product requirements or architecture could affect the team structure.

 

 

Continuously monitor the integrated team structure to detect problems such as mismanaged interfaces, and mismatches between the work assigned and the staff performing the work. Take corrective action, including assessing the deployed teams and structures, when performance does not meet expectations.

Changes in team structure can include the following:

·       Retiring a team for a period of time (e.g., while long-duration manufacturing or verifications are done)

·       Disbanding a team when it is no longer cost effective in serving the project

·       Combining teams to achieve operating efficiencies

·       Adding teams as new product components are identified for development
SP 3.3         Allocate Requirements to Integrated Teams

Allocate requirements, responsibilities, tasks, and interfaces to teams in the integrated team structure.

This allocation of requirements to integrated teams is done before any teams are formed to verify that the integrated team structure is workable and covers all the necessary requirements, responsibilities, authorities, tasks, and interfaces. Once the structure is confirmed, integrated team sponsors are chosen to establish the individual teams in the structure.

Typical Work Products

1.    Responsibilities allocated to each integrated team

2.    Work product requirements, technical interfaces, and business (e.g., cost accounting and project management) interfaces each integrated team will be responsible for satisfying

3.    List of integrated team sponsors

Subpractices

1.    Allocate the tasks, responsibilities, and work products to be delivered, and the associated requirements and interfaces to the appropriate integrated teams.

Business, management, and other nontechnical responsibilities and authorities for each integrated team are necessary elements to proper team function. Integrated team responsibilities and authorities are normally developed by the project and are consistent with established organization practices.

 

 
Example responsibilities and authorities, include the following:

·       Authority of teams to pick their own leader

·       Authority of teams to implement subteams (e.g., a product team forming an integration subteam)

·       Reporting chains

·       Reporting requirements (cost, schedule, and performance status)

·       Progress reporting measures and methods

 

2.    Check that the distribution of requirements and interfaces covers all specified product requirements and other requirements.

In the event that complete coverage of requirements is not achieved, corrective action should be taken to redistribute requirements or to alter the integrated team structure.

3.    Designate the sponsor for each integrated team.

An integrated team sponsor is a manager (individual or team) who is responsible for establishing and providing resources to an integrated team, monitoring its activities and progress, and taking corrective action when needed. A sponsor may manage one or many teams. Team sponsors can be project managers.
SP 3.4         Establish Integrated Teams

Establish and maintain integrated teams in the structure.

The integrated teams within the integrated team structure are established by the team sponsors. This process encompasses choosing team leaders and team members, and establishing the team charter for each integrated team based on the allocation of requirements. It also involves providing the resources required to accomplish the tasks assigned to the team.

Refer to the Establish Rules and Guidelines for Integrated Teams specific practice in the Organizational Process Definition +IPPD process area for more information about establishing organizational rules and guidelines for structuring and forming integrated teams.

Typical Work Products

1.    List of team leaders

2.    List of team members assigned to each integrated team

3.    Integrated team charters

4.    Measures for evaluating the performance of integrated teams

5.    Periodic integrated team status reports

Subpractices

1.    Choose a leader for each integrated team.

The extent of organizational and project direction in selecting the leader is often a function of product risk and complexity or an organization’s need to “grow” new leaders. Team sponsors may select the team leader or team members may vote on a leader from within the team, depending on organizational policies.

2.    Allocate resources to each integrated team.

The people and other resources are allocated to each integrated team. These items are discussed with the team to ensure that the resources are adequate and that the people are adequate to carry out the tasks and are compatible with other members of the team.

3.    Charter each integrated team.

The team charter is the contract among the team members and between the team and its sponsor for the expected work and level of performance. Charters establish the rights, guarantees, privileges, and permissions for organizing and performing the team’s assigned requirements and interfaces, responsibilities and tasks. The integrated team and its sponsor develop the team charter as a negotiation activity. When both approve it, the team charter constitutes a recognized agreement with management authority.

Charters can include the following aspects:

·       How assignments are accepted

·       How resources and input are accessed

·       How work gets done

·       Who checks and reviews work

·       How work is approved

·       How work is delivered and communicated

4.    Review the composition of an integrated team and its place in the integrated team structure when its team leader changes or another significant change of membership occurs.

A change of this kind may significantly affect the ability of the team to accomplish its objectives. A review of the match between the new composition and the current responsibilities should be made. If the match is not satisfactory, the team composition should be changed or the team’s responsibility should be modified.

5.    Review the composition of a team and its tasking when a change in team responsibility occurs.

Changes in responsibilities often occur as the project moves from one phase to the next. For example, less design expertise on teams may be needed when detailed design is completed and fabrication and integration of product components begins.

6.    Manage the overall performance of the teams.

The charter should specify how both team and individual performance will be measured and should include the critical success factors for the team within the project.
SP 3.5         Ensure Collaboration among Interfacing Teams

Ensure collaboration among interfacing teams.

The success of an integrated team-based project is a function of how effectively and successfully the integrated teams collaborate with one another to achieve project objectives. This collaboration may be accomplished using interface control working groups.

See the Coordinate and Collaborate with Relevant Stakeholders specific goal of this process area for more information about managing stakeholder involvement, critical dependencies, and resolving coordination issues.

Refer to the Establish Rules and Guidelines for Integrated Teams specific practice in the Organizational Process Definition +IPPD process area for more information about establishing organizational expectations and rules that will guide how the integrated teams work collectively.

[Measurement and Analysis]()

A Support Process Area at Maturity Level 2

Purpose

The purpose of Measurement and Analysis (MA) is to develop and sustain a measurement capability that is used to support management information needs.

Introductory Notes

The Measurement and Analysis process area involves the following:

·         Specifying the objectives of measurement and analysis such that they are aligned with identified information needs and objectives

·         Specifying the measures, analysis techniques, and mechanism for data collection, data storage, reporting, and feedback

·         Implementing the collection, storage, analysis, and reporting of the data

·         Providing objective results that can be used in making informed decisions, and taking appropriate corrective actions

The integration of measurement and analysis activities into the processes of the project supports the following:

·         Objective planning and estimating

·         Tracking actual performance against established plans and objectives

·         Identifying and resolving process-related issues

·         Providing a basis for incorporating measurement into additional processes in the future

The staff required to implement a measurement capability may or may not be employed in a separate organization-wide program. Measurement capability may be integrated into individual projects or other organizational functions (e.g., quality assurance).

The initial focus for measurement activities is at the project level. However, a measurement capability may prove useful for addressing organization- and/or enterprise-wide information needs. To support this capability, the measurement activities should support information needs at multiple levels including the business, organizational unit, and project to minimize re-work as the organization matures.

Projects may choose to store project-specific data and results in a project-specific repository. When data are shared more widely across projects, the data may reside in the organization’s measurement repository.

Measurement and analysis of the product components provided by suppliers is essential for effective management of the quality and costs of the project. It is possible, with careful management of supplier agreements, to provide insight into the data that support supplier-performance analysis.

Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Align Measurement and Analysis Activities

Measurement objectives and activities are aligned with identified information needs and objectives.

The specific practices covered under this specific goal may be addressed concurrently or in any order:

·         When establishing measurement objectives, experts often think ahead about necessary criteria for specifying measures and analysis procedures. They also think concurrently about the constraints imposed by data collection and storage procedures.

·         It often is important to specify the essential analyses that will be conducted before attending to details of measurement specification, data collection, or storage.
SP 1.1         Establish Measurement Objectives

Establish and maintain measurement objectives that are derived from identified information needs and objectives.

Measurement objectives document the purposes for which measurement and analysis are done, and specify the kinds of actions that may be taken based on the results of data analyses.

The sources for measurement objectives may be management, technical, project, product, or process implementation needs.

The measurement objectives may be constrained by existing processes, available resources, or other measurement considerations. Judgments may need to be made about whether the value of the results will be commensurate with the resources devoted to doing the work.

Modifications to identified information needs and objectives may, in turn, be indicated as a consequence of the process and results of measurement and analysis.

Sources of information needs and objectives may include the following:

·         Project plans

·         Monitoring of project performance

·         Interviews with managers and others who have information needs

·         Established management objectives

·         Strategic plans

·         Business plans

·         Formal requirements or contractual obligations

·         Recurring or other troublesome management or technical problems

·         Experiences of other projects or organizational entities

·         External industry benchmarks

·         Process improvement plans
Example measurement objectives include the following:

·         Reduce time to delivery

·         Reduce total lifecycle cost

·         Deliver specified functionality completely

·         Improve prior levels of quality

·         Improve prior customer satisfaction ratings

·         Maintain and improve the acquirer/supplier relationships

Typical Work Products

1.    Measurement objectives

Subpractices

1.    Document information needs and objectives.

Information needs and objectives are documented to allow traceability to subsequent measurement and analysis activities.

2.    Prioritize information needs and objectives.

It may be neither possible nor desirable to subject all initially identified information needs to measurement and analysis. Priorities may also need to be set within the limits of available resources.

3.    Document, review, and update measurement objectives.

It is important to carefully consider the purposes and intended uses of measurement and analysis.

The measurement objectives are documented, reviewed by management and other relevant stakeholders, and updated as necessary. Doing so enables traceability to subsequent measurement and analysis activities, and helps ensure that the analyses will properly address identified information needs and objectives.

It is important that users of measurement and analysis results be involved in setting measurement objectives and deciding on plans of action. It may also be appropriate to involve those who provide the measurement data.

4.    Provide feedback for refining and clarifying information needs and objectives as necessary.

Identified information needs and objectives may need to be refined and clarified as a result of setting measurement objectives. Initial descriptions of information needs may be unclear or ambiguous. Conflicts may arise between existing needs and objectives. Precise targets on an already existing measure may be unrealistic.

5.    Maintain traceability of the measurement objectives to the identified information needs and objectives.

There must always be a good answer to the question, “Why are we measuring this?”

Of course, the measurement objectives may also change to reflect evolving information needs and objectives.
SP 1.2         Specify Measures

Specify measures to address the measurement objectives.

Measurement objectives are refined into precise, quantifiable measures.

Measures may be either “base” or “derived.” Data for base measures are obtained by direct measurement. Data for derived measures come from other data, typically by combining two or more base measures.
Examples of commonly used base measures include the following:

·         Estimates and actual measures of work product size (e.g., number of pages)

·         Estimates and actual measures of effort and cost (e.g., number of person hours)

·         Quality measures (e.g., number of defects by severity)

 

Examples of commonly used derived measures include the following:

·         Earned Value

·         Schedule Performance Index

·         Defect density

·         Peer review coverage

·         Test or verification coverage

·         Reliability measures (e.g., mean time to failure)

·         Quality measures (e.g., number of defects by severity/total number of defects)

 

Derived measures typically are expressed as ratios, composite indices, or other aggregate summary measures. They are often more quantitatively reliable and meaningfully interpretable than the base measures used to generate them.

Typical Work Products

1.    Specifications of base and derived measures

Subpractices

1.    Identify candidate measures based on documented measurement objectives.

The measurement objectives are refined into specific measures. The identified candidate measures are categorized and specified by name and unit of measure.

2.    Identify existing measures that already address the measurement objectives.

Specifications for measures may already exist, perhaps established for other purposes earlier or elsewhere in the organization.

3.    Specify operational definitions for the measures.

Operational definitions are stated in precise and unambiguous terms. They address two important criteria as follows:

·       Communication: What has been measured, how was it measured, what are the units of measure, and what has been included or excluded?

·       Repeatability: Can the measurement be repeated, given the same definition, to get the same results?

4.    Prioritize, review, and update measures.

Proposed specifications of the measures are reviewed for their appropriateness with potential end users and other relevant stakeholders. Priorities are set or changed, and specifications of the measures are updated as necessary.
SP 1.3         Specify Data Collection and Storage Procedures

Specify how measurement data will be obtained and stored.

Explicit specification of collection methods helps ensure that the right data are collected properly. It may also aid in further clarifying information needs and measurement objectives.

Proper attention to storage and retrieval procedures helps ensure that data are available and accessible for future use.

Typical Work Products

1.    Data collection and storage procedures

2.    Data collection tools

Subpractices

1.    Identify existing sources of data that are generated from current work products, processes, or transactions.

Existing sources of data may already have been identified when specifying the measures. Appropriate collection mechanisms may exist whether or not pertinent data have already been collected.

2.    Identify measures for which data are needed, but are not currently available.

3.    Specify how to collect and store the data for each required measure.

Explicit specifications are made of how, where, and when the data will be collected. Procedures for collecting valid data are specified. The data are stored in an accessible manner for analysis, and it is determined whether they will be saved for possible reanalysis or documentation purposes.

Questions to be considered typically include the following:

·       Have the frequency of collection and the points in the process where measurements will be made been determined?

·       Has the timeline that is required to move measurement results from the points of collection to repositories, other databases, or end users been established?

·       Who is responsible for obtaining the data?

·       Who is responsible for data storage, retrieval, and security?

·       Have necessary supporting tools been developed or acquired?

4.    Create data collection mechanisms and process guidance.

Data collection and storage mechanisms are well integrated with other normal work processes. Data collection mechanisms may include manual or automated forms and templates. Clear, concise guidance on correct procedures is available to those responsible for doing the work. Training is provided as necessary to clarify the processes necessary for collection of complete and accurate data and to minimize the burden on those who must provide and record the data.

5.    Support automatic collection of the data where appropriate and feasible.

Automated support can aid in collecting more complete and accurate data.
Examples of such automated support include the following:

·       Time stamped activity logs

·       Static or dynamic analyses of artifacts

 

However, some data cannot be collected without human intervention (e.g., customer satisfaction or other human judgments), and setting up the necessary infrastructure for other automation may be costly.

6.    Prioritize, review, and update data collection and storage procedures.

Proposed procedures are reviewed for their appropriateness and feasibility with those who are responsible for providing, collecting, and storing the data. They also may have useful insights about how to improve existing processes, or be able to suggest other useful measures or analyses.

7.    Update measures and measurement objectives as necessary.

Priorities may need to be reset based on the following:

·       The importance of the measures

·       The amount of effort required to obtain the data

Considerations include whether new forms, tools, or training would be required to obtain the data.
SP 1.4         Specify Analysis Procedures

Specify how measurement data will be analyzed and reported.

Specifying the analysis procedures in advance ensures that appropriate analyses will be conducted and reported to address the documented measurement objectives (and thereby the information needs and objectives on which they are based). This approach also provides a check that the necessary data will in fact be collected.

Typical Work Products

1.    Analysis specifications and procedures

2.    Data analysis tools

Subpractices

1.    Specify and prioritize the analyses that will be conducted and the reports that will be prepared.

Early attention should be paid to the analyses that will be conducted and to the manner in which the results will be reported. These should meet the following criteria:

·       The analyses explicitly address the documented measurement objectives

·       Presentation of the results is clearly understandable by the audiences to whom the results are addressed

Priorities may have to be set within available resources.

2.    Select appropriate data analysis methods and tools.

Refer to the Select Measures and Analytic Techniques and Apply Statistical Methods to Understand Variation specific practices of the Quantitative Project Management process area for more information about the appropriate use of statistical analysis techniques and understanding variation, respectively.

Issues to be considered typically include the following:

·       Choice of visual display and other presentation techniques (e.g., pie charts, bar charts, histograms, radar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, or tables)

·       Choice of appropriate descriptive statistics (e.g., arithmetic mean, median, or mode)

·       Decisions about statistical sampling criteria when it is impossible or unnecessary to examine every data element

·       Decisions about how to handle analysis in the presence of missing data elements

·       Selection of appropriate analysis tools

Descriptive statistics are typically used in data analysis to do the following:

·       Examine distributions on the specified measures (e.g., central tendency, extent of variation, or data points exhibiting unusual variation)

·       Examine the interrelationships among the specified measures (e.g., comparisons of defects by phase of the product’s lifecycle or by product component)

·       Display changes over time

3.    Specify administrative procedures for analyzing the data and communicating the results.

Issues to be considered typically include the following:

·       Identifying the persons and groups responsible for analyzing the data and presenting the results

·       Determining the timeline to analyze the data and present the results

·       Determining the venues for communicating the results (e.g., progress reports, transmittal memos, written reports, or staff meetings)

4.   Review and update the proposed content and format of the specified analyses and reports.

All of the proposed content and format are subject to review and revision, including analytic methods and tools, administrative procedures, and priorities. The relevant stakeholders consulted should include intended end users, sponsors, data analysts, and data providers.

5.    Update measures and measurement objectives as necessary.

Just as measurement needs drive data analysis, clarification of analysis criteria can affect measurement. Specifications for some measures may be refined further based on the specifications established for data analysis procedures. Other measures may prove to be unnecessary, or a need for additional measures may be recognized.

The exercise of specifying how measures will be analyzed and reported may also suggest the need for refining the measurement objectives themselves.

6.    Specify criteria for evaluating the utility of the analysis results and for evaluating the conduct of the measurement and analysis activities.

Criteria for evaluating the utility of the analysis might address the extent to which the following apply:

·       The results are (1) provided on a timely basis, (2) understandable, and (3) used for decision making.

·       The work does not cost more to perform than is justified by the benefits that it provides.

Criteria for evaluating the conduct of the measurement and analysis might include the extent to which the following apply:

·       The amount of missing data or the number of flagged inconsistencies is beyond specified thresholds.

·       There is selection bias in sampling (e.g., only satisfied end users are surveyed to evaluate end-user satisfaction, or only unsuccessful projects are evaluated to determine overall productivity).

·       The measurement data are repeatable (e.g., statistically reliable).

·       Statistical assumptions have been satisfied (e.g., about the distribution of data or about appropriate measurement scales).
SG 2            Provide Measurement Results

Measurement results, which address identified information needs and objectives, are provided.

The primary reason for doing measurement and analysis is to address identified information needs and objectives. Measurement results based on objective evidence can help to monitor performance, fulfill contractual obligations, make informed management and technical decisions, and enable corrective actions to be taken.
SP 2.1         Collect Measurement Data

Obtain specified measurement data.

The data necessary for analysis are obtained and checked for completeness and integrity.

Typical Work Products

1.    Base and derived measurement data sets

2.    Results of data integrity tests

Subpractices

1.    Obtain the data for base measures.

Data are collected as necessary for previously used as well as for newly specified base measures. Existing data are gathered from project records or from elsewhere in the organization.

Note that data that were collected earlier may no longer be available for reuse in existing databases, paper records, or formal repositories.

2.    Generate the data for derived measures.

Values are newly calculated for all derived measures.

3.    Perform data integrity checks as close to the source of the data as possible.

All measurements are subject to error in specifying or recording data. It is always better to identify such errors and to identify sources of missing data early in the measurement and analysis cycle.

Checks can include scans for missing data, out-of-bounds data values, and unusual patterns and correlation across measures. It is particularly important to do the following:

·       Test and correct for inconsistency of classifications made by human judgment (i.e., to determine how frequently people make differing classification decisions based on the same information, otherwise known as “inter-coder reliability”).

·       Empirically examine the relationships among the measures that are used to calculate additional derived measures. Doing so can ensure that important distinctions are not overlooked and that the derived measures convey their intended meanings (otherwise known as “criterion validity”).
SP 2.2         Analyze Measurement Data

Analyze and interpret measurement data.

The measurement data are analyzed as planned, additional analyses are conducted as necessary, results are reviewed with relevant stakeholders, and necessary revisions for future analyses are noted.

Typical Work Products

1.    Analysis results and draft reports

Subpractices

1.    Conduct initial analyses, interpret the results, and draw preliminary conclusions.

The results of data analyses are rarely self-evident. Criteria for interpreting the results and drawing conclusions should be stated explicitly.

2.    Conduct additional measurement and analysis as necessary, and prepare results for presentation.

The results of planned analyses may suggest (or require) additional, unanticipated analyses. In addition, they may identify needs to refine existing measures, to calculate additional derived measures, or even to collect data for additional base measures to properly complete the planned analysis. Similarly, preparing the initial results for presentation may identify the need for additional, unanticipated analyses.

3.    Review the initial results with relevant stakeholders.

It may be appropriate to review initial interpretations of the results and the way in which they are presented before disseminating and communicating them more widely.

Reviewing the initial results before their release may prevent needless misunderstandings and lead to improvements in the data analysis and presentation.

Relevant stakeholders with whom reviews may be conducted include intended end users and sponsors, as well as data analysts and data providers.

4.    Refine criteria for future analyses.

Valuable lessons that can improve future efforts are often learned from conducting data analyses and preparing results. Similarly, ways to improve measurement specifications and data collection procedures may become apparent, as may ideas for refining identified information needs and objectives.
SP 2.3         Store Data and Results

Manage and store measurement data, measurement specifications, and analysis results.

Storing measurement-related information enables the timely and cost-effective future use of historical data and results. The information also is needed to provide sufficient context for interpretation of the data, measurement criteria, and analysis results.

Information stored typically includes the following:

·         Measurement plans

·         Specifications of measures

·         Sets of data that have been collected

·         Analysis reports and presentations

The stored information contains or references the information needed to understand and interpret the measures and to assess them for reasonableness and applicability (e.g., measurement specifications used on different projects when comparing across projects).

Data sets for derived measures typically can be recalculated and need not be stored. However, it may be appropriate to store summaries based on derived measures (e.g., charts, tables of results, or report prose).

Interim analysis results need not be stored separately if they can be efficiently reconstructed.

Projects may choose to store project-specific data and results in a project-specific repository. When data are shared more widely across projects, the data may reside in the organization’s measurement repository.

Refer to the Establish the Organization’s Measurement Repository specific practice of the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about establishing the organization’s measurement repository.

Refer to the Configuration Management process area for information about managing measurement work products.

Typical Work Products

1.    Stored data inventory

Subpractices

1.    Review the data to ensure their completeness, integrity, accuracy, and currency.

2.    Store the data according to the data storage procedures.

3.    Make the stored contents available for use only by appropriate groups and personnel.

4.    Prevent the stored information from being used inappropriately.
Examples of ways to prevent inappropriate use of the data and related information include controlling access to data and educating people on the appropriate use of data.

 

Examples of inappropriate use include the following:

·       Disclosure of information that was provided in confidence

·       Faulty interpretations based on incomplete, out-of-context, or otherwise misleading information

·       Measures used to improperly evaluate the performance of people or to rank projects

·       Impugning the integrity of specific individuals

 

SP 2.4         Communicate Results

Report results of measurement and analysis activities to all relevant stakeholders.

The results of the measurement and analysis process are communicated to relevant stakeholders in a timely and usable fashion to support decision making and assist in taking corrective action.

Relevant stakeholders include intended users, sponsors, data analysts, and data providers.

Typical Work Products

1.    Delivered reports and related analysis results

2.    Contextual information or guidance to aid in the interpretation of analysis results

Subpractices

1.    Keep relevant stakeholders apprised of measurement results on a timely basis.

Measurement results are communicated in time to be used for their intended purposes. Reports are unlikely to be used if they are distributed with little effort to follow up with those who need to know the results.

To the extent possible and as part of the normal way they do business, users of measurement results are kept personally involved in setting objectives and deciding on plans of action for measurement and analysis. The users are regularly kept apprised of progress and interim results.

Refer to the Project Monitoring and Control process area for more information about the use of measurement results.

2.    Assist relevant stakeholders in understanding the results.

Results are reported in a clear and concise manner appropriate to the methodological sophistication of the relevant stakeholders. They are understandable, easily interpretable, and clearly tied to identified information needs and objectives.

The data are often not self-evident to practitioners who are not measurement experts. Measurement choices should be explicitly clear about the following:

·       How and why the base and derived measures were specified

·       How the data were obtained

·       How to interpret the results based on the data analysis methods that were used

·       How the results address information needs
Examples of actions to assist in understanding of results include the following:

·       Discussing the results with the relevant stakeholders

·       Providing a transmittal memo that provides background and explanation

·       Briefing users on the results

·       Providing training on the appropriate use and understanding of measurement results

[Organizational Innovation and Deployment]()

A Process Management Process Area at Maturity Level 5

Purpose

The purpose of Organizational Innovation and Deployment (OID) is to select and deploy incremental and innovative improvements that measurably improve the organization’s processes and technologies. The improvements support the organization’s quality and process-performance objectives as derived from the organization’s business objectives.

Introductory Notes

The Organizational Innovation and Deployment process area enables the selection and deployment of improvements that can enhance the organization’s ability to meet its quality and process-performance objectives. (See the definition of “quality and process-performance objectives” in the glossary.) The term “improvement,” as used in this process area, refers to all of the ideas (proven and unproven) that would change the organization’s processes and technologies to better meet the organization’s quality and process-performance objectives.

Quality and process-performance objectives that this process area might address include the following:

·         Improved product quality (e.g., functionality, performance)

·         Increased productivity

·         Decreased cycle time

·         Greater customer and end-user satisfaction

·         Shorter development or production time to change functionality or add new features, or adapt to new technologies

·         Reduce delivery time

·         Reduce time to adapt to new technologies and business needs

Achievement of these objectives depends on the successful establishment of an infrastructure that enables and encourages all people in the organization to propose potential improvements to the organization’s processes and technologies. Achievement of these objectives also depends on being able to effectively evaluate and deploy proposed improvements to the organization’s processes and technologies. All members of the organization can participate in the organization’s process- and technology-improvement activities. Their proposals are systematically gathered and addressed.

Pilots are conducted to evaluate significant changes involving untried, high-risk, or innovative improvements before they are broadly deployed.

Process and technology improvements that will be deployed across the organization are selected from process- and technology-improvement proposals based on the following criteria:

·         A quantitative understanding of the organization’s current quality and process performance

·         The organization’s quality and process-performance objectives

·         Estimates of the improvement in quality and process performance resulting from deploying the process and technology improvements

·         Estimated costs of deploying process and technology improvements, and the resources and funding available for such deployment

The expected benefits added by the process and technology improvements are weighed against the cost and impact to the organization. Change and stability must be balanced carefully. Change that is too great or too rapid can overwhelm the organization, destroying its investment in organizational learning represented by organizational process assets. Rigid stability can result in stagnation, allowing the changing business environment to erode the organization’s business position.

Improvements are deployed, as appropriate, to new and ongoing projects.

In this process area, the term “process and technology improvements” refers to incremental and innovative improvements to processes and also to process or product technologies (including project work environments).

The informative material in this process area is written with the assumption that the specific practices are applied to a quantitatively managed process. The specific practices of this process area may be applicable, but with reduced value, if the assumption is not met.

The specific practices in this process area complement and extend those found in the Organizational Process Focus process area. The focus of this process area is process improvement that is based on a quantitative knowledge of the organization’s set of standard processes and technologies and their expected quality and performance in predictable situations. In the Organizational Process Focus process area, no assumptions are made about the quantitative basis of improvement.

Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Select Improvements

Process and technology improvements, which contribute to meeting quality and process-performance objectives, are selected.
SP 1.1         Collect and Analyze Improvement Proposals

Collect and analyze process- and technology-improvement proposals.

Each process- and technology-improvement proposal must be analyzed.

Simple process and technology improvements, with well-understood benefits and effects, will not usually undergo detailed evaluations.
Examples of simple process and technology improvements include the following:

·         Add an item to a peer review checklist.

·         Combine the technical review and management review for suppliers into a single technical/management review.

 

Typical Work Products

1.    Analyzed process- and technology-improvement proposals

Subpractices

1.    Collect process- and technology-improvement proposals.

A process- and technology-improvement proposal documents proposed incremental and innovative improvements to specific processes and technologies. Managers and staff in the organization, as well as customers, end users, and suppliers can submit process- and technology-improvement proposals. Process and technology improvements may be implemented at the local level before being proposed for the organization.
Examples of sources for process- and technology-improvement proposals include the following:

·       Findings and recommendations from process appraisals

·       The organization’s quality and process-performance objectives

·       Analysis of data about customer and end-user problems as well as customer and end-user satisfaction

·       Analysis of data about project performance compared to quality and productivity objectives

·       Analysis of technical performance measures

·       Results of process and product benchmarking efforts

·       Analysis of data on defect causes

·       Measured effectiveness of process activities

·       Measured effectiveness of project work environments

·       Examples of process- and technology-improvement proposals that were successfully adopted elsewhere

·       Feedback on previously submitted process- and technology-improvement proposals

·       Spontaneous ideas from managers and staff

 

Refer to the Organizational Process Focus process area for more information about process- and technology-improvement proposals.

2.    Analyze the costs and benefits of process- and technology-improvement proposals as appropriate.

Process- and technology-improvement proposals that have a large cost-to-benefit ratio are rejected.

Criteria for evaluating costs and benefits include the following:

·       Contribution toward meeting the organization’s quality and process-performance objectives

·       Effect on mitigating identified project and organizational risks

·       Ability to respond quickly to changes in project requirements, market situations, and the business environment

·       Effect on related processes and associated assets

·       Cost of defining and collecting data that supports the measurement and analysis of the process- and technology-improvement proposal

·       Expected life span of the proposal

Process- and technology-improvement proposals that would not improve the organization's processes are rejected.

Process-performance models provide insight into the effect of process changes on process capability and performance.

Refer to the Organizational Process Performance process area for more information about process-performance models.

3.    Identify the process- and technology-improvement proposals that are innovative.

Innovative improvements are also identified and analyzed in the Identify and Analyze Innovations specific practice.

Whereas this specific practice analyzes proposals that have been passively collected, the purpose of the Identify and Analyze Innovations specific practice is to actively search for and locate innovative improvements. The search primarily involves looking outside the organization.

Innovative improvements are typically identified by reviewing process- and technology-improvement proposals or by actively investigating and monitoring innovations that are in use in other organizations or are documented in research literature. Innovation may be inspired by internal improvement objectives or by the external business environment.

Innovative improvements are typically major changes to the process that represent a break from the old way of doing things (e.g., changing the lifecycle model). Innovative improvements may also include changes in the products that support, enhance, or automate the process (e.g., using off-the-shelf products to support the process).
Examples of innovative improvements include the following:

·       Advances in computer and related hardware products

·       New support tools

·       New techniques, methodologies, processes, or lifecycle models

·       New interface standards

·       New reusable components

·       New management techniques

·       New quality-improvement techniques

·       New process development and deployment support tools

 

4.    Identify potential barriers and risks to deploying each process- and technology-improvement proposal.
Examples of barriers to deploying process and technology improvements include the following:

·       Turf guarding and parochial perspectives

·       Unclear or weak business rationale

·       Lack of short-term benefits and visible successes

·       Unclear picture of what is expected from everyone

·       Too many changes at the same time

·       Lack of involvement and support of relevant stakeholders

 

Examples of risk factors that affect the deployment of process and technology improvements include the following:

·       Compatibility of the improvement with existing processes, values, and skills of potential end users

·       Complexity of the improvement

·       Difficulty implementing the improvement

·       Ability to demonstrate the value of the improvement before widespread deployment

·       Justification for large, up-front investments in areas such as tools and training

·       Inability to overcome “technology drag” where the current implementation is used successfully by a large and mature installed base of end users

 

5.    Estimate the cost, effort, and schedule required for deploying each process- and technology-improvement proposal.

6.    Select the process- and technology-improvement proposals to be piloted before broadscale deployment.

Since innovations, by definition, usually represent a major change, most innovative improvements will be piloted.

7.    Document the results of the evaluation of each process- and technology-improvement proposal.

8.    Monitor the status of each process- and technology-improvement proposal.
SP 1.2         Identify and Analyze Innovations

Identify and analyze innovative improvements that could increase the organization’s quality and process performance.

The specific practice, Collect and Analyze Improvement Proposals, analyzes proposals that are passively collected. The purpose of this specific practice is to actively search for, locate, and analyze innovative improvements. This search primarily involves looking outside the organization.

Typical Work Products

1.    Candidate innovative improvements

2.    Analysis of proposed innovative improvements

Subpractices

1.    Analyze the organization's set of standard processes to determine areas where innovative improvements would be most helpful.

These analyses are performed to determine which subprocesses are critical to achieving the organization’s quality and process-performance objectives and which ones are good candidates to be improved.

2.    Investigate innovative improvements that may improve the organization's set of standard processes.

Investigating innovative improvements involves the following:

·       Systematically maintaining awareness of leading relevant technical work and technology trends

·       Periodically searching for commercially available innovative improvements

·       Collecting proposals for innovative improvements from the projects and the organization

·       Systematically reviewing processes and technologies used externally and comparing them to those used within the organization

·       Identifying areas where innovative improvements have been used successfully, and reviewing data and documentation of experience using these improvements

·       Identifying improvements that integrate new technology into products and project work environments

3.    Analyze potential innovative improvements to understand their effects on process elements and predict their influence on the process.

Process-performance models can provide a basis for analyzing possible effects of changes to process elements.

Refer to the Organizational Process Performance process area for more information about process-performance models.

4.    Analyze the costs and benefits of potential innovative improvements.

Innovative improvements that have a very large cost-to-benefit ratio are rejected.

5.    Create process- and technology-improvement proposals for those innovative improvements that would result in improving the organization's processes or technologies.

6.    Select the innovative improvements to be piloted before broadscale deployment.

Since innovations, by definition, usually represent a major change, most innovative improvements will be piloted.

7.    Document the results of the evaluations of innovative improvements.
SP 1.3         Pilot Improvements

Pilot process and technology improvements to select which ones to implement.

Pilots are performed to assess new and unproven major changes before they are broadly deployed, as appropriate.

The implementation of this specific practice may overlap with the implementation of the Implement the Action Proposals specific practice in the Causal Analysis and Resolution process area (e.g., when causal analysis and resolution is implemented organizationally or across multiple projects).

Typical Work Products

1.    Pilot evaluation reports

2.    Documented lessons learned from pilots

Subpractices

1.    Plan the pilots.

When planning pilots, it is critical to define quantitative criteria to be used for evaluating pilot results.

2.    Review and get relevant stakeholder agreement on the plans for the pilots.

3.    Consult with and assist the people performing the pilots.

4.    Perform each pilot in an environment that is characteristic of the environment present in a broadscale deployment.

5.    Track the pilots against their plans.

6.    Review and document the results of pilots.

Pilot results are evaluated using the quantitative criteria defined during pilot planning. Reviewing and documenting the results of pilots usually involves the following:

·       Deciding whether to terminate the pilot, replan and continue the pilot, or proceed with deploying the process and technology improvement

·       Updating the disposition of process- and technology-improvement proposals associated with the pilot

·       Identifying and documenting new process- and technology-improvement proposals as appropriate

·       Identifying and documenting lessons learned and problems encountered during the pilot
SP 1.4         Select Improvements for Deployment

Select process and technology improvements for deployment across the organization.

Selection of process and technology improvements for deployment across the organization is based on quantifiable criteria derived from the organization’s quality and process-performance objectives.

Typical Work Products

1.    Process and technology improvements selected for deployment

Subpractices

1.    Prioritize the candidate process and technology improvements for deployment.

Priority is based on an evaluation of the estimated cost-to-benefit ratio with regard to the quality and process-performance objectives.

Refer to the Organizational Process Performance process area for more information about quality and process-performance objectives.

2.    Select the process and technology improvements to be deployed.

The selection of the process improvements is based on their priorities and the available resources.

3.    Determine how each process and technology improvement will be deployed.
Examples of where the process and technology improvements may be deployed include the following:

·       Organizational process assets

·       Project-specific or common work environments

·       Organization’s product families

·       Organization's capabilities

·       Organization’s projects

·       Organizational groups

 

4.    Document the results of the selection process.

The results of the selection process usually include the following:

·       The selection criteria for candidate improvements

·       The disposition of each improvement proposal

·       The rationale for the disposition of each improvement proposal

·       The assets to be changed for each selected improvement
SG 2            Deploy Improvements

Measurable improvements to the organization's processes and technologies are continually and systematically deployed.

SP 2.1         Plan the Deployment

Establish and maintain the plans for deploying the selected process and technology improvements.

The plans for deploying each process and technology improvement may be included in the organization’s plan for organizational innovation and deployment or they may be documented separately.

The implementation of this specific practice complements the Deploy Organizational Process Assets specific practice in the Organizational Process Focus process area, and adds the use of quantitative data to guide the deployment and to determine the value of the improvements with respect to quality and process-performance objectives.

Refer to the Organizational Process Focus process area for more information about deploying organizational process assets.

This specific practice plans the deployment of individual process and technology improvements. The Plan the Process generic practice addresses comprehensive planning that covers the specific practices in this process area.

Typical Work Products

1.    Deployment plan for selected process and technology improvements

Subpractices

1.    Determine how each process and technology improvement must be adjusted for organization-wide deployment.

Process and technology improvements proposed within a limited context (e.g., for a single project) might have to be modified to work across the organization.

2.    Determine the changes necessary to deploy each process and technology improvement.
Examples of changes needed to deploy a process and technology improvement include the following:

·       Process descriptions, standards, and procedures

·       Work environments

·       Education and training

·       Skills

·       Existing commitments

·       Existing activities

·       Continuing support to end users

·       Organizational culture and characteristics

 

3.    Identify strategies to address potential barriers to deploying each process and technology improvement.

4.    Establish measures and objectives for determining the value of each process and technology improvement with respect to the organization’s quality and process-performance objectives.

·       Time to recover the cost of the process or technology improvement

·       Measured improvement in the project’s or organization’s process performance

·       Number and types of project and organizational risks mitigated by the process or technology improvement

·       Average time required to respond to changes in project requirements, market situations, and the business environment

 

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for more information about establishing objectives for measurement and analysis, specifying the measures and analyses to be performed, obtaining and analyzing measures, and reporting results.

5.    Document the plan for deploying each process and technology improvement.

6.    Review and get agreement with relevant stakeholders on the plan for deploying each process and technology improvement.

7.    Revise the plan for deploying each process and technology improvement as necessary.
SP 2.2         Manage the Deployment

Manage the deployment of the selected process and technology improvements.

The implementation of this specific practice may overlap with the implementation of the Implement the Action Proposals specific practice in the Causal Analysis and Resolution process area (e.g., when causal analysis and resolution is implemented organizationally or across multiple projects). The primary difference is that in the Causal Analysis and Resolution process area, planning is done to manage the removal of the root causes of defects or problems from the project’s defined processes. In the Organizational Innovation and Deployment process area, planning is done to manage the deployment of improvements to the organization’s processes and technologies that can be quantified against the organization’s business objectives.

Typical Work Products

1.    Updated training materials (to reflect deployed process and technology improvements)

2.    Documented results of process- and technology-improvement deployment activities

3.    Revised process- and technology-improvement measures, objectives, priorities, and deployment plans

·       Coordinating the activities of projects, support groups, and organizational groups for each process and technology improvement

·       Coordinating the activities for deploying related process and technology improvements

3.    Quickly deploy process and technology improvements in a controlled and disciplined manner, as appropriate.
Examples of methods for quickly deploying process and technology improvements include the following:

·       Using red-lines, process change notices, or other controlled process documentation as interim process descriptions

·       Deploying process and technology improvements incrementally, rather than as a single deployment

·       Providing comprehensive consulting to early adopters of the process and technology improvement in lieu of revised formal training

 

4.    Incorporate the process and technology improvements into organizational process assets, as appropriate.

Refer to the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about organizational process assets.

5.    Coordinate the deployment of the process and technology improvements into the projects' defined processes as appropriate.

Refer to the Organizational Process Focus process area for more information about deploying organizational process assets.

9.    Determine whether the ability of the defined process to meet quality and process-performance objectives is adversely affected by the process and technology improvement, and take corrective action as necessary.

Refer to the Quantitative Project Management process area for more information about quantitatively managing the project’s defined process to achieve the project’s established quality and process-performance objectives.

10.  Document and review the results of process- and technology-improvement deployment.

Documenting and reviewing the results includes the following:

·       Identifying and documenting lessons learned

·       Identifying and documenting new process- and technology-improvement proposals

·       Revising process- and technology-improvement measures, objectives, priorities, and deployment plans
SP 2.3         Measure Improvement Effects

Measure the effects of the deployed process and technology improvements.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for more information about establishing objectives for measurement and analysis, specifying the measures and analyses to be performed, obtaining and analyzing measures, and reporting results.

The implementation of this specific practice may overlap with the implementation of the Evaluate the Effect of Changes specific practice in the Causal Analysis and Resolution process area (e.g., when causal analysis and resolution is implemented organizationally or across multiple projects).

Typical Work Products

1.    Documented measures of the effects resulting from the deployed process and technology improvements

Subpractices

1.    Measure the actual cost, effort, and schedule for deploying each process and technology improvement.

[Organizational Process Definition +IPPD]()

A Process Management Process Area at Maturity Level 3

Purpose

The purpose of Organizational Process Definition (OPD) is to establish and maintain a usable set of organizational process assets and work environment standards.

**IPPD Addition**

For IPPD, Organizational Process Definition +IPPD also covers the establishment of organizational rules and guidelines that enable conducting work using integrated teams.

 

Introductory Notes

Organizational process assets enable consistent process performance across the organization and provide a basis for cumulative, long-term benefits to the organization. (See the definition of “organizational process assets” in the glossary.)

The organization’s process asset library is a collection of items maintained by the organization for use by the people and projects of the organization. This collection of items includes descriptions of processes and process elements, descriptions of lifecycle models, process tailoring guidelines, process-related documentation, and data. The organization’s process asset library supports organizational learning and process improvement by allowing the sharing of best practices and lessons learned across the organization.

The organization’s set of standard processes is tailored by projects to create their defined processes. The other organizational process assets are used to support tailoring as well as the implementation of the defined processes. The work environment standards are used to guide creation of project work environments.

A standard process is composed of other processes (i.e., subprocesses) or process elements. A process element is the fundamental (e.g., atomic) unit of process definition and describes the activities and tasks to consistently perform work. Process architecture provides rules for connecting the process elements of a standard process. The organization’s set of standard processes may include multiple process architectures.

(See the definitions of “standard process,” “process architecture,” “subprocess,” and “process element” in the glossary.)
The organizational process assets may be organized in many ways, depending on the implementation of the Organizational Process Definition process area. Examples include the following:

·         Descriptions of lifecycle models may be documented as part of the organization’s set of standard processes, or they may be documented separately.

·         The organization’s set of standard processes may be stored in the organization’s process asset library, or they may be stored separately.

·         A single repository may contain both the measurements and the process-related documentation, or they may be stored separately.

 

Related Process Areas

**IPPD Addition**

SG 2 Enable IPPD Management

SP 2.1       Establish Empowerment Mechanisms

SP 2.2       Establish Rules and Guidelines for Integrated Teams

SP 2.3       Balance Team and Home Organization Responsibilities

 

 
Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Establish Organizational Process Assets

A set of organizational process assets is established and maintained.

 
IPPD Addition

Integrated processes that emphasize parallel rather than serial development are a cornerstone of IPPD implementation. The processes for developing the product and for developing product-related lifecycle processes, such as the manufacturing process and the support process, are integrated and conducted concurrently. Such integrated processes should accommodate the information provided by stakeholders representing all phases of the product lifecycle from both business and technical functions. Processes for effective teamwork are also needed.

 

SP 1.1         Establish Standard Processes

Establish and maintain the organization's set of standard processes.

Standard processes may be defined at multiple levels in an enterprise and they may be related in a hierarchical manner. For example, an enterprise may have a set of standard processes that is tailored by individual organizations (e.g., a division or site) in the enterprise to establish their set of standard processes. The set of standard processes may also be tailored for each of the organization’s business areas or product lines. Thus “the organization’s set of standard processes” can refer to the standard processes established at the organization level and standard processes that may be established at lower levels, although some organizations may only have a single level of standard processes. (See the definitions of “standard process” and “organization’s set of standard processes” in the glossary.)

Multiple standard processes may be needed to address the needs of different application domains, lifecycle models, methodologies, and tools. The organization’s set of standard processes contains process elements (e.g., a work product size-estimating element) that may be interconnected according to one or more process architectures that describe the relationships among these process elements.

The organization’s set of standard processes typically includes technical, management, administrative, support, and organizational processes.

 
IPPD Addition

In an IPPD environment, the organization's set of standard processes includes a process that projects use to establish a shared vision.

 

The organization’s set of standard processes should collectively cover all processes needed by the organization and projects, including those processes addressed by the process areas at Maturity Level 2.

Typical Work Products

1.    Organization's set of standard processes

Subpractices

1.    Decompose each standard process into constituent process elements to the detail needed to understand and describe the process.

Each process element covers a bounded and closely related set of activities. The descriptions of the process elements may be templates to be filled in, fragments to be completed, abstractions to be refined, or complete descriptions to be tailored or used unmodified. These elements are described in sufficient detail such that the process, when fully defined, can be consistently performed by appropriately trained and skilled people.
Examples of process elements include the following:

·       Template for generating work product size estimates

·       Description of work product design methodology

·       Tailorable peer review methodology

·       Template for conduct of management reviews

 

2.    Specify the critical attributes of each process element.
Examples of critical attributes include the following:

·       Process roles

·       Applicable standards

·       Applicable procedures, methods, tools, and resources

·       Process-performance objectives

·       Entry criteria

·       Inputs

·       Product and process measures to be collected and used

·       Verification points (e.g., peer reviews)

·       Outputs

·       Interfaces

·       Exit criteria

 

3.    Specify the relationships of the process elements.
Examples of relationships include the following:

·       Ordering of the process elements

·       Interfaces among the process elements

·       Interfaces with external processes

·       Interdependencies among the process elements

 

The rules for describing the relationships among process elements are referred to as “process architecture.” The process architecture covers the essential requirements and guidelines. The detailed specifications of these relationships are covered in the descriptions of the defined processes that are tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes.

4.    Ensure that the organization's set of standard processes adheres to applicable policies, standards, and models.

Adherence to applicable process standards and models is typically demonstrated by developing a mapping from the organization’s set of standard processes to the relevant process standards and models. In addition, this mapping will be a useful input to future appraisals.

5.    Ensure that the organization’s set of standard processes satisfies the process needs and objectives of the organization.

Refer to the Organizational Process Focus process area for more information about establishing and maintaining the organization’s process needs and objectives.

6.    Ensure that there is appropriate integration among the processes that are included in the organization’s set of standard processes.

7.    Document the organization's set of standard processes.

8.    Conduct peer reviews on the organization's set of standard processes.

Refer to the Verification process area for more information about peer review.

9.    Revise the organization's set of standard processes as necessary.
SP 1.2         Establish Lifecycle Model Descriptions

Establish and maintain descriptions of the lifecycle models approved for use in the organization.

Lifecycle models may be developed for a variety of customers or in a variety of situations, since one lifecycle model may not be appropriate for all situations. Lifecycle models are often used to define the phases of the project. Also, the organization may define different lifecycle models for each type of product and service it delivers.

Typical Work Products

1.    Descriptions of lifecycle models

Subpractices

1.    Select lifecycle models based on the needs of projects and the organization.
For example, project lifecycle models include the following:

·       Waterfall

·       Spiral

·       Evolutionary

·       Incremental

·       Iterative

 

2.    Document the descriptions of the lifecycle models.

The lifecycle models may be documented as part of the organization’s standard process descriptions or they may be documented separately.

3.    Conduct peer reviews on the lifecycle models.

Refer to the Verification process area for more information about conducting peer reviews.

4.    Revise the descriptions of the lifecycle models as necessary.
SP 1.3         Establish Tailoring Criteria and Guidelines

Establish and maintain the tailoring criteria and guidelines for the organization's set of standard processes.

 
IPPD Addition

In creating the tailoring criteria and guidelines, include considerations for concurrent development and operating with integrated teams. For example, how one tailors the manufacturing process will be different depending on whether it is developed serially after the product has been developed or in parallel with the development of the product, as in IPPD. Processes, such as resource allocation, will also be tailored differently if the project is operating with integrated teams.

 

The tailoring criteria and guidelines describe the following:

·         How the organization’s set of standard processes and organizational process assets are used to create the defined processes

·         Mandatory requirements that must be satisfied by the defined processes (e.g., the subset of the organizational process assets that are essential for any defined process)

·         Options that can be exercised and criteria for selecting among the options

·         Procedures that must be followed in performing and documenting process tailoring
Examples of reasons for tailoring include the following:

·         Adapting the process for a new product line or work environment

·         Customizing the process for a specific application or class of similar applications

·         Elaborating the process description so that the resulting defined process can be performed

 

Flexibility in tailoring and defining processes is balanced with ensuring appropriate consistency in the processes across the organization. Flexibility is needed to address contextual variables such as the domain; nature of the customer; cost, schedule, and quality tradeoffs; technical difficulty of the work; and experience of the people implementing the process. Consistency across the organization is needed so that organizational standards, objectives, and strategies are appropriately addressed, and process data and lessons learned can be shared.

Tailoring criteria and guidelines may allow for using a standard process “as is,” with no tailoring.

Typical Work Products

1.    Tailoring guidelines for the organization's set of standard processes

Subpractices

1.    Specify the selection criteria and procedures for tailoring the organization's set of standard processes.
Examples of criteria and procedures include the following:

·       Criteria for selecting lifecycle models from those approved by the organization

·       Criteria for selecting process elements from the organization’s set of standard processes

·       Procedures for tailoring the selected lifecycle models and process elements to accommodate specific process characteristics and needs

 

Examples of tailoring actions include the following:

·       Modifying a lifecycle model

·       Combining elements of different lifecycle models

·       Modifying process elements

·       Replacing process elements

·       Reordering process elements

 

2.    Specify the standards for documenting the defined processes.

3.    Specify the procedures for submitting and obtaining approval of waivers from the requirements of the organization’s set of standard processes.

4.    Document the tailoring guidelines for the organization's set of standard processes.

Refer to the Verification process area for more information about conducting peer reviews.

6.    Revise the tailoring guidelines as necessary.
SP 1.4         Establish the Organization’s Measurement Repository

Establish and maintain the organization’s measurement repository.

Refer to the Use Organizational Process Assets for Planning Project Activities specific practice of the Integrated Project Management process area for more information about the use of the organization’s measurement repository in planning project activities.

The repository contains both product and process measures that are related to the organization’s set of standard processes. It also contains or refers to the information needed to understand and interpret the measures and assess them for reasonableness and applicability. For example, the definitions of the measures are used to compare similar measures from different processes.

Typical Work Products

1.    Definition of the common set of product and process measures for the organization’s set of standard processes

2.    Design of the organization’s measurement repository

3.    Organization's measurement repository (that is, the repository structure and support environment)

4.    Organization’s measurement data

Subpractices

1.    Determine the organization's needs for storing, retrieving, and analyzing measurements.

2.    Define a common set of process and product measures for the organization's set of standard processes.

The measures in the common set are selected based on the organization’s set of standard processes. They are selected for their ability to provide visibility into process performance to support expected business objectives. The common set of measures may vary for different standard processes.

Operational definitions for the measures specify the procedures for collecting valid data and the point in the process where the data will be collected.
Examples of classes of commonly used measures include the following:

·       Estimates of work product size (e.g., pages)

·       Estimates of effort and cost (e.g., person hours)

·       Actual measures of size, effort, and cost

·       Quality measures (e.g., number of defects found or severity of defects)

·       Peer review coverage

·       Test coverage

·       Reliability measures (e.g., mean time to failure)

 

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for more information about defining measures.

3.    Design and implement the measurement repository.

4.    Specify the procedures for storing, updating, and retrieving measures.

5.    Conduct peer reviews on the definitions of the common set of measures and the procedures for storing and retrieving measures.

Refer to the Verification process area for more information about conducting peer reviews.

6.    Enter the specified measures into the repository.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for more information about collecting and analyzing data.

7.    Make the contents of the measurement repository available for use by the organization and projects as appropriate.

8.    Revise the measurement repository, common set of measures, and procedures as the organization’s needs change.

Examples of when the common set of measures may need to be revised include the following:

·       New processes are added

·       Processes are revised and new measures are needed

·       Finer granularity of data is required

·       Greater visibility into the process is required

·       Measures are retired
SP 1.5         Establish the Organization’s Process Asset Library

IPPD Addition SG 2            Enable IPPD Management

Organizational rules and guidelines, which govern the operation of integrated teams, are provided.

An organizational infrastructure that supports and promotes IPPD concepts is critical if it is to be successfully sustained over the long term. These rules and guidelines promote concepts such as integrated teaming and allow for empowered decision making at many levels. Through its rules and guidelines, the organization demonstrates commitment to IPPD and the success of its integrated teams.

IPPD rules and guidelines become part of the organization’s set of standard processes and the project’s defined process. The organization’s standard processes enable, promote, and reinforce the behaviors expected from projects, integrated teams, and people. These expected behaviors are typically communicated in the form of policies, operating procedures, guidelines, and other organizational process assets.
SP 2.1         Establish Empowerment Mechanisms

Establish and maintain empowerment mechanisms to enable timely decision making.

In a successful IPPD environment, clear channels of responsibility and authority must be established. Issues can arise at any level of the organization when integrated teams assume too much or too little authority and when it is unclear who is responsible for making decisions. Documenting and deploying organizational guidelines that clearly define the empowerment of integrated teams can prevent these issues.

 

 

 

 

Implementing IPPD introduces challenges to leadership because of the cultural changes required when people and integrated teams are empowered and decisions are driven to the lowest level appropriate. Effective and efficient communication mechanisms are critical to timely and sound decision making in the integrated work environment. Once an integrated team project structure is established and training is provided, mechanisms to handle empowerment, decision making, and issue resolution also need to be provided.

Refer to the Decision Analysis and Resolution process area for more information about decision making.

 

 

Typical Work Products

1.    Empowerment rules and guidelines for people and integrated teams

2.    Decision-making rules and guidelines

3.    Issue resolution documentation

Subpractices

1.    Determine rules and guidelines for the degree of empowerment provided to people and integrated teams.
Factors to consider regarding integrated team empowerment include the following:

·       Authority of teams to pick their own leader

·       Authority of teams to implement subteams (e.g., a product team forming an integration subteam)

·       The degree of collective decision making

·       The level of consensus needed for integrated team decisions

·       How conflicts and differences of opinion within the integrated teams are addressed and resolved

 

2.    Determine rules and guidelines for the use of different decision types in making various kinds of team decisions.

3.    Define the process for using the decision-making rules and guidelines.

4.    Define a process for issue resolution when an issue cannot be decided at the level at which it arose.

Refer to the Resolve Coordination Issues specific practice in the Integrated Project Management process area for more information about resolving issues with relevant stakeholders.

5.    Maintain the empowerment mechanisms and the rules and guidelines for decision making.
SP 2.2         Establish Rules and Guidelines for Integrated Teams

Establish and maintain organizational rules and guidelines for structuring and forming integrated teams.

 

 

Operating rules and guidelines for the integrated teams define and control how teams interact to accomplish objectives. These rules and guidelines also promote the effective leveraging of the teams’ efforts, high performance, and productivity. Integrated team members must understand the standards for work and participate according to those standards.

Typical Work Products

1.    Rules and guidelines for the structuring and formation of integrated teams

Subpractices

1.    Establish rules and guidelines for structuring and forming integrated teams.
Organizational process assets can help the project to structure and implement integrated teams. Such assets may include the following:

·       Team structure guidelines

·       Team formation guidelines

·       Team authority and responsibility guidelines

·       IPPD implementation techniques

·       Guidelines for managing risks in IPPD

·       Guidelines for establishing lines of communication and authority

·       Team leader selection criteria

·       Team responsibility guidelines

 

 

 

 

2.    Define the expectations, rules, and guidelines that will guide how the integrated teams work collectively.

These rules and guidelines establish organizational practices for consistency across integrated teams and can include the following:

·       How interfaces among integrated teams are established and maintained

·       How assignments are accepted

·       How resources and input are accessed

·       How work gets done

·       Who checks, reviews, and approves work

·       How work is approved

·       How work is delivered and communicated

·       Reporting chains

·       Reporting requirements (cost, schedule, and performance status), measures, and methods

·       Progress reporting measures and methods

3.    Maintain the rules and guidelines for structuring and forming integrated teams.
SP 2.3         Balance Team and Home Organization Responsibilities

Establish and maintain organizational guidelines to help team members balance their team and home organization responsibilities.

A “home organization” is the part of the organization to which team members are assigned when they are not on an integrated team. A home organization may be called a “functional organization,” “home base,” “home office,” or “direct organization.” Home organizations are often responsible for the career growth of their members (e.g., performance appraisals and training to maintain functional and discipline expertise).

In an IPPD environment, reporting procedures and rating systems assume that members’ responsibilities are focused on the integrated team, not on the home organization. However, the responsibility of integrated team members to their home organizations is also important, specifically for process implementation and improvement. Workloads and responsibilities should be balanced between projects and functions, and career growth and advancement. Organizational mechanisms should exist that support the home organization while aligning the workforce to meet business objectives in a teaming environment.

Sometimes teams persist beyond their productive life in organizations that do not have a home organization for the team members to return to after the integrated the team is dissolved. Therefore, there should be guidelines for disbanding the integrated teams and maintaining home organizations.

Typical Work Products

1.    Organizational guidelines for balancing team and home organization responsibilities

2.    Performance review process that considers both functional supervisor and team leader input

Subpractices

1.    Establish guidelines for home organization responsibilities that promote integrated team behavior.

2.    Establish guidelines for team management responsibilities to ensure integrated team members report appropriately to their home organizations.

3.    Establish a performance review process that considers input from both home organization and integrated team leaders.

4.    Maintain the guidelines for balancing team and home organization responsibilities.

[Organizational Process Focus]()

A Process Management Process Area at Maturity Level 3

Purpose

The purpose of Organizational Process Focus (OPF) is to plan, implement, and deploy organizational process improvements based on a thorough understanding of the current strengths and weaknesses of the organization’s processes and process assets.

Introductory Notes

The organization's processes include all the processes used by the organization and its projects. Candidate improvements to the organization's processes and process assets are obtained from various sources, including measurement of the processes, lessons learned in implementing the processes, results of process appraisals, results of product evaluation activities, results of benchmarking against other organizations’ processes, and recommendations from other improvement initiatives in the organization.

Process improvement occurs within the context of the organization’s needs and is used to address the organization’s objectives. The organization encourages participation in process improvement activities by those who will perform the process. The responsibility for facilitating and managing the organization’s process improvement activities, including coordinating the participation of others, is typically assigned to a process group. The organization provides the long-term commitment and resources required to sponsor this group and to ensure the effective and timely deployment of the improvements.

Careful planning is required to ensure that process improvement efforts across the organization are adequately managed and implemented. The organization’s planning for process improvement results in a process improvement plan.

The organization’s process improvement plan will address appraisal planning, process action planning, pilot planning, and deployment planning. Appraisal plans describe the appraisal timeline and schedule, the scope of the appraisal, the resources required to perform the appraisal, the reference model against which the appraisal will be performed, and the logistics for the appraisal.

Process action plans usually result from appraisals and document how specific improvements targeting the weaknesses uncovered by an appraisal will be implemented. In cases in which it is determined that the improvement described in the process action plan should be tested on a small group before deploying it across the organization, a pilot plan is generated.

Finally, when the improvement is to be deployed, a deployment plan is used. This plan describes when and how the improvement will be deployed across the organization.

Organizational process assets are used to describe, implement, and improve the organization's processes (see the definition of “organizational process assets” in the glossary).
Related Process Areas

Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Determine Process Improvement Opportunities

Strengths, weaknesses, and improvement opportunities for the organization's processes are identified periodically and as needed.

Strengths, weaknesses, and improvement opportunities may be determined relative to a process standard or model such as a CMMI model or International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard. The process improvements should be selected specifically to address the organization’s needs.
SP 1.1         Establish Organizational Process Needs

Establish and maintain the description of the process needs and objectives for the organization.

 
IPPD Addition

Integrated processes that emphasize parallel rather than serial development are a cornerstone of IPPD implementation. The processes for developing the product and for developing product-related lifecycle processes, such as the manufacturing process and the support process processes, are integrated and conducted concurrently. Such integrated processes need to accommodate the information provided by stakeholders representing all phases of the product lifecycle from both business and technical functions. Processes for effective teamwork will also be needed.

 

IPPD Addition

Examples of processes for effective teamwork include the following:

·       Communications

·       Collaborative decision making

·       Issue resolution

·       Team building

 

 

The organization’s processes operate in a business context that must be understood. The organization’s business objectives, needs, and constraints determine the needs and objectives for the organization’s processes. Typically, the issues related to finance, technology, quality, human resources, and marketing are important process considerations.

The organization’s process needs and objectives cover aspects that include the following:

·         Characteristics of the processes

·         Process-performance objectives, such as time-to-market and delivered quality

·         Process effectiveness

Typical Work Products

1.    Organization’s process needs and objectives

Subpractices

1.    Identify the policies, standards, and business objectives that are applicable to the organization's processes.

2.    Examine relevant process standards and models for best practices.

3.    Determine the organization’s process-performance objectives.

Process-performance objectives may be expressed in quantitative or qualitative terms.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for more information about establishing measurement objectives.
Examples of process-performance objectives include the following:

·       Cycle time

·       Defect removal rates

·       Productivity

 

4.    Define the essential characteristics of the organization’s processes.

The essential characteristics of the organization’s processes are determined based on the following:

·       Processes currently being used in the organization

·       Standards imposed by the organization

·       Standards commonly imposed by customers of the organization
Examples of process characteristics include the following:

·       Level of detail used to describe the processes

·       Process notation used

·       Granularity of the processes

 

5.    Document the organization’s process needs and objectives.

6.    Revise the organization’s process needs and objectives as needed.
SP 1.2         Appraise the Organization’s Processes

Appraise the organization's processes periodically and as needed to maintain an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.

Process appraisals may be performed for the following reasons:

·         To identify processes that should be improved

·         To confirm progress and make the benefits of process improvement visible

·         To satisfy the needs of a customer-supplier relationship

·         To motivate and facilitate buy-in

The buy-in gained during a process appraisal can be eroded significantly if it is not followed by an appraisal-based action plan.

Typical Work Products

1.    Plans for the organization's process appraisals

2.    Appraisal findings that address strengths and weaknesses of the organization's processes

3.    Improvement recommendations for the organization's processes

Subpractices

1.    Obtain sponsorship of the process appraisal from senior management.

Senior management sponsorship includes the commitment to have the organization's managers and staff participate in the process appraisal and to provide the resources and funding to analyze and communicate the findings of the appraisal.

2.    Define the scope of the process appraisal.

Process appraisals may be performed on the entire organization or may be performed on a smaller part of an organization such as a single project or business area.

The scope of the process appraisal addresses the following:

·       Definition of the organization (e.g., sites or business areas) that will be covered by the appraisal

·       Identification of the project and support functions that will represent the organization in the appraisal

·       Processes that will be appraised

3.    Determine the method and criteria for process appraisal.

Process appraisals can occur in many forms. Process appraisals should address the needs and objectives of the organization, which may change over time. For example, the appraisal may be based on a process model, such as a CMMI model, or on a national or international standard, such as ISO 9001 [ISO 2000]. The appraisals may also be based on a benchmark comparison with other organizations. The appraisal method may assume a variety of characteristics in terms of time and effort expended, makeup of the appraisal team, and the method and depth of investigation.

4.    Plan, schedule, and prepare for the process appraisal.

5.    Conduct the process appraisal.

6.    Document and deliver the appraisal’s activities and findings.
SP 1.3         Identify the Organization's Process Improvements

Identify improvements to the organization's processes and process assets.

Typical Work Products

1.    Analysis of candidate process improvements

2.    Identification of improvements for the organization's processes

Subpractices

1.    Determine candidate process improvements.

Candidate process improvements are typically determined by doing the following:

·       Measure the processes and analyze the measurement results

·       Review the processes for effectiveness and suitability

·       Review the lessons learned from tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes

·       Review the lessons learned from implementing the processes

·       Review process improvement proposals submitted by the organization’s managers, staff, and other relevant stakeholders

·       Solicit inputs on process improvements from senior management and leaders in the organization

·       Examine the results of process appraisals and other process-related reviews

·       Review results of other organizational improvement initiatives

2.    Prioritize the candidate process improvements.

Criteria for prioritization are as follows:

·       Consider the estimated cost and effort to implement the process improvements

·       Appraise the expected improvement against the organization’s improvement objectives and priorities

·       Determine the potential barriers to the process improvements and develop strategies for overcoming these barriers
Examples of techniques to help determine and prioritize the possible improvements to be implemented include the following:

·       A gap analysis that compares current conditions in the organization with optimal conditions

·       Force-field analysis of potential improvements to identify potential barriers and strategies for overcoming those barriers

·       Cause-and-effect analyses to provide information on the potential effects of different improvements that can then be compared

 

3.    Identify and document the process improvements that will be implemented.

4.    Revise the list of planned process improvements to keep it current.
SG 2            Plan and Implement Process Improvements

Process actions that address improvements to the organization’s processes and process assets are planned and implemented.

Successful implementation of improvements requires participation in process action planning and implementation by process owners, those performing the process, and support organizations.
SP 2.1         Establish Process Action Plans

Establish and maintain process action plans to address improvements to the organization's processes and process assets.

Establishing and maintaining process action plans typically involves the following roles:

·         Management steering committees to set strategies and oversee process improvement activities

·         Process group staff to facilitate and manage process improvement activities

·         Process action teams to define and implement process actions

·         Process owners to manage deployment

·         Practitioners to perform the process

This involvement helps to obtain buy-in on the process improvements and increases the likelihood of effective deployment.

Process action plans are detailed implementation plans. These plans differ from the organization’s process improvement plan in that they are plans targeting specific improvements that have been defined to address weaknesses usually uncovered by appraisals.

Typical Work Products

1.    Organization's approved process action plans

Subpractices

1.    Identify strategies, approaches, and actions to address the identified process improvements.

New, unproven, and major changes are piloted before they are incorporated into normal use.

SG 3            Deploy Organizational Process Assets and Incorporate Lessons Learned

The organizational process assets are deployed across the organization and process-related experiences are incorporated into the organizational process assets.

The specific practices within this specific goal describe ongoing activities. New opportunities to benefit from the organizational process assets and changes to them may arise throughout the life of each project. Deployment of the standard processes and other organizational process assets must be continually supported within the organization, particularly for new projects at startup.
SP 3.1         Deploy Organizational Process Assets

Deploy organizational process assets across the organization.

Deploying organizational process assets or changes to organizational process assets should be performed in an orderly manner. Some organizational process assets or changes to organizational process assets may not be appropriate for use in some parts of the organization (because of customer requirements or the current lifecycle phase being implemented, for example). It is therefore important that those that are or will be executing the process, as well as other organization functions (such as training and quality assurance), be involved in the deployment as necessary.

Refer to the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about how the deployment of organizational process assets is supported and enabled by the organization’s process asset library.

Typical Work Products

1.    Plans for deploying organizational process assets and changes to them across the organization

2.    Training materials for deploying organizational process assets and changes to them

3.    Documentation of changes to organizational process assets

4.    Support materials for deploying organizational process assets and changes to them

Subpractices

1.    Deploy organizational process assets across the organization.

Typical activities performed as a part of this deployment include the following:

·       Identifying the organizational process assets that should be adopted by those who perform the process

·       Determining how the organizational process assets are made available (e.g., via Web site)

·       Identifying how changes to the organizational process assets are communicated

·       Identifying the resources (e.g., methods and tools) needed to support the use of the organizational process assets

·       Planning the deployment

·       Assisting those who use the organizational process assets

·       Ensuring that training is available for those who use the organizational process assets

Refer to the Organizational Training process area for more information about coordination of training.

2.    Document the changes to the organizational process assets.

Documenting changes to the organizational process assets serves two main purposes:

·       To enable communication of the changes

·       To understand the relationship of changes in the organizational process assets to changes in process performance and results

3.    Deploy the changes that were made to the organizational process assets across the organization.

Typical activities performed as a part of deploying changes include the following:

·       Determining which changes are appropriate for those who perform the process

·       Planning the deployment

·       Arranging for the associated support needed to successfully transition the changes

4.    Provide guidance and consultation on the use of the organizational process assets.
SP 3.2         Deploy Standard Processes

Deploy the organization’s set of standard processes to projects at their startup and deploy changes to them as appropriate throughout the life of each project.

It is important that new projects use proven and effective processes to perform critical early activities (e.g., project planning, receiving requirements, and obtaining resources).

Projects should also periodically update their defined processes to incorporate the latest changes made to the organization’s set of standard processes when it will benefit them. This periodic updating helps to ensure that all project activities derive the full benefit of what other projects have learned.

Refer to the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about the organization’s set of standard processes and tailoring guidelines.

Typical Work Products

1.    Organization's list of projects and status of process deployment on each project (i.e., existing and planned projects)

2.    Guidelines for deploying the organization’s set of standard processes on new projects

3.    Records of tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes and implementing them on identified projects

Subpractices

3.    Establish plans to implement the organization’s current set of standard processes on the identified projects.

4.    Assist projects in tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes to meet project needs.

Refer to the Integrated Project Management process area for more information about tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes to meet the unique needs and objectives of the project.

5.    Maintain records of tailoring and implementing processes on the identified projects.

6.    Ensure that the defined processes resulting from process tailoring are incorporated into the plans for process-compliance audits.

Process-compliance audits address objective evaluations of project activities against the project’s defined processes.

7.    As the organization’s set of standard processes are updated, identify which projects should implement the changes.
SP 3.3         Monitor Implementation

Monitor the implementation of the organization’s set of standard processes and use of process assets on all projects.

By monitoring implementation, the organization ensures that the organization’s set of standard processes and other process assets are appropriately deployed to all projects. Monitoring implementation also helps the organization develop an understanding of the organizational process assets being used and where they are used within the organization. Monitoring also helps to establish a broader context for interpreting and using process and product measures, lessons learned, and improvement information obtained from projects.

Typical Work Products

1.    Results of monitoring process implementation on projects

2.    Status and results of process-compliance evaluations

3.    Results of reviewing selected process artifacts created as part of process tailoring and implementation

Subpractices

3.    Derive lessons learned from defining, piloting, implementing, and deploying the organizational process assets.

4.    Make available lessons learned to the people in the organization as appropriate.

Actions may have to be taken to ensure that lessons learned are used appropriately.
Examples of inappropriate use of lessons learned include the following:

·       Evaluating the performance of people

·       Judging process performance or results

 

Examples of ways to prevent inappropriate use of lessons learned include the following:

·       Controlling access to the lessons learned

·       Educating people about the appropriate use of lessons learned

 

 

5.    Analyze the organization's common set of measures.

[Organizational Process Performance]()

A Process Management Process Area at Maturity Level 4

Purpose

The purpose of Organizational Process Performance (OPP) is to establish and maintain a quantitative understanding of the performance of the organization’s set of standard processes in support of quality and process-performance objectives, and to provide the process-performance data, baselines, and models to quantitatively manage the organization’s projects.

Introductory Notes

Process performance is a measure of the actual results achieved by following a process. Process performance is characterized by process measures (e.g., effort, cycle time, and defect removal effectiveness) and product measures (e.g., reliability, defect density, capacity, response time, and cost).

The common measures for the organization are composed of process and product measures that can be used to summarize the actual performance of processes in individual projects in the organization. The organizational data for these measures are analyzed to establish a distribution and range of results, which characterize the expected performance of the process when used on any individual project in the organization.

In this process area, the phrase “quality and process-performance objectives” covers objectives and requirements for product quality, service quality, and process performance. As indicated above, the term “process performance” includes quality; however, to emphasize the importance of quality, the phrase “quality and process-performance objectives” is used rather than just “process-performance objectives.”

The expected process performance can be used in establishing the project’s quality and process-performance objectives and can be used as a baseline against which actual project performance can be compared. This information is used to quantitatively manage the project. Each quantitatively managed project, in turn, provides actual performance results that become a part of the baseline data for the organizational process assets.

The associated process-performance models are used to represent past and current process performance and to predict future results of the process. For example, the latent defects in the delivered product can be predicted using measurements of defects identified during product verification activities.

When the organization has measures, data, and analytical techniques for critical process, product, and service characteristics, it is able to do the following:

·         Determine whether processes are behaving consistently or have stable trends (i.e., are predictable)

·         Identify processes where the performance is within natural bounds that are consistent across process implementation teams

·         Establish criteria for identifying whether a process or subprocess should be statistically managed, and determine pertinent measures and analytical techniques to be used in such management

·         Identify processes that show unusual (e.g., sporadic or unpredictable) behavior

·         Identify any aspects of the processes that can be improved in the organization’s set of standard processes

·         Identify the implementation of a process which performs best

Specific Goal and Practice Summary

SG 1 Establish Performance Baselines and Models

SP 1.1       Select Processes

SP 1.2       Establish Process-Performance Measures

SP 1.3       Establish Quality and Process-Performance Objectives

SP 1.4       Establish Process-Performance Baselines

SP 1.5       Establish Process-Performance Models

 
Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Establish Performance Baselines and Models

Baselines and models, which characterize the expected process performance of the organization's set of standard processes, are established and maintained.

Prior to establishing process-performance baselines and models, it is necessary to determine which processes are suitable to be measured (the Select Processes specific practice), which measures are useful for determining process performance (the Establish Process-Performance Measures specific practice), and the quality and process-performance objectives for those processes (the Establish Quality and Process-Performance Objectives specific practice). These specific practices are often interrelated and may need to be performed concurrently to select the appropriate processes, measures, and quality and process-performance objectives. Often, the selection of one process, measure, or objective will constrain the selection of the others. For example, if a certain process is selected, the measures and objectives for that process may be constrained by the process itself.
SP 1.1         Select Processes

Select the processes or subprocesses in the organization's set of standard processes that are to be included in the organization's process-performance analyses.

Refer to the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about the structure of the organizational process assets.

The organization’s set of standard processes consists of a set of standard processes that, in turn, are composed of subprocesses.

Typically, it will not be possible, useful, or economically justifiable to apply statistical management techniques to all processes or subprocesses of the organization’s set of standard processes. Selection of the processes and/or subprocesses is based on the needs and objectives of both the organization and projects.
Examples of criteria which may be used for the selection of a process or subprocess for organizational analysis include the following:

·         The relationship of the subprocess to key business objectives

·         Current availability of valid historical data relevant to the subprocess

·         The current degree of variability of this data

·         Subprocess stability (e.g. stable performance in comparable instances)

·         The availability of corporate or commercial information that can be used to build predictive models

 

The existence of project data that indicates the process or subprocess has been or can be stabilized is a useful criterion for selection of a process or subprocess.

Typical Work Products

1.    List of processes or subprocesses identified for process-performance analyses
SP 1.2         Establish Process-Performance Measures

Establish and maintain definitions of the measures that are to be included in the organization’s process-performance analyses.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for more information about selecting measures.

Typical Work Products

1.    Definitions for the selected measures of process performance

Subpractices

1.    Determine which of the organization’s business objectives for quality and process performance need to be addressed by the measures.

2.    Select measures that provide appropriate insight into the organization’s quality and process performance.

The Goal Question Metric paradigm is an approach that can be used to select measures that provide insight into the organization’s business objectives.
Examples of criteria used to select measures include the following:

·       Relationship of the measures to the organization’s business objectives

·       Coverage that the measures provide over the entire life of the product or service

·       Visibility that the measures provide into the process performance

·       Availability of the measures

·       Extent to which the measures are objective

·       Frequency at which the observations of the measure can be collected

·       Extent to which the measures are controllable by changes to the process or subprocess

·       Extent to which the measures represent the users’ view of effective process performance

 

3.    Incorporate the selected measures into the organization’s set of common measures.

Refer to the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about establishing organizational process assets.

4.    Revise the set of measures as necessary.
SP 1.3         Establish Quality and Process-Performance Objectives

Establish and maintain quantitative objectives for quality and process performance for the organization.

The organization’s quality and process-performance objectives should have the following attributes:

·         Based on the organization’s business objectives

·         Based on the past performance of projects

·         Defined to gauge process performance in areas such as product quality, productivity, cycle time, or response time

·         Constrained by the inherent variability or natural bounds of the selected process or subprocess

Typical Work Products

1.    Organization's quality and process-performance objectives

Subpractices

1.    Review the organization’s business objectives related to quality and process performance.
Examples of business objectives include the following:

·       Achieve a development cycle of a specified duration for a specified release of a product

·       Achieve an average response time less than a specified duration for a specified version of a service

·       Deliver functionality of the product to a target percentage of estimated cost

·       Decrease the cost of maintenance of the products by a specified percent

 

2.    Define the organization’s quantitative objectives for quality and process performance.

Objectives may be established for process or subprocess measurements (e.g., effort, cycle time, and defect removal effectiveness) as well as for product measurements (e.g., reliability and defect density) and service measurements (e.g., capacity and response times) where appropriate.
Examples of quality and process-performance objectives include the following:

·       Achieve a specified productivity

·       Deliver work products with no more than a specified number of latent defects

·       Shorten time to delivery to a specified percentage of the process-performance baseline

·       Reduce the total lifecycle cost of new and existing products by a percentage

·       Deliver a percentage of the specified product functionality

 

3.    Define the priorities of the organization’s objectives for quality and process performance.

4.    Review, negotiate, and obtain commitment for the organization’s quality and process-performance objectives and their priorities from the relevant stakeholders.

5.    Revise the organization’s quantitative objectives for quality and process performance as necessary.
Examples of when the organization’s quantitative objectives for quality and process performance may need to be revised include the following:

·       When the organization’s business objectives change

·       When the organization’s processes change

·       When actual quality and process performance differs significantly from the objectives

 

SP 1.4         Establish Process-Performance Baselines

Establish and maintain the organization's process-performance baselines.

The organization’s process-performance baselines are a measurement of performance for the organization’s set of standard processes at various levels of detail, as appropriate. The processes include the following:

·         Sequence of connected processes

·         Processes that cover the entire life of the project

·         Processes for developing individual work products

There may be several process-performance baselines to characterize performance for subgroups of the organization.
Examples of criteria used to categorize subgroups include the following:

·         Product line

·         Line of business

·         Application domain

·         Complexity

·         Team size

·         Work product size

·         Process elements from the organization’s set of standard processes

 

Allowable tailoring of the organization’s set of standard processes may significantly affect the comparability of the data for inclusion in process-performance baselines. The effects of tailoring should be considered in establishing baselines. Depending on the tailoring allowed, separate performance baselines may exist for each type of tailoring.

Refer to the Quantitative Project Management process area for more information about the use of process-performance baselines.

Typical Work Products

1.    Baseline data on the organization’s process performance

Subpractices

1.    Collect measurements from the organization’s projects.

The process or subprocess in use when the measurement was taken is recorded to enable appropriate use later.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for information about collecting and analyzing data.

2.    Establish and maintain the organization’s process-performance baselines from the collected measurements and analyses.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for information about establishing objectives for measurement and analysis, specifying the measures and analyses to be performed, obtaining and analyzing measures, and reporting results.

Process-performance baselines are derived by analyzing the collected measures to establish a distribution and range of results that characterize the expected performance for selected processes or subprocesses when used on any individual project in the organization.

The measurements from stable subprocesses from projects should be used; other data may not be reliable.

3.    Review and get agreement with relevant stakeholders about the organization's process-performance baselines.

4.    Make the organization's process-performance information available across the organization in the organization's measurement repository.

The organization’s process-performance baselines are used by the projects to estimate the natural bounds for process performance.

Refer to the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about establishing the organization’s measurement repository.

5.    Compare the organization’s process-performance baselines to the associated objectives.

6.    Revise the organization’s process-performance baselines as necessary.
Examples of when the organization’s process-performance baselines may need to be revised include the following:

·       When the processes change

·       When the organization’s results change

·       When the organization’s needs change

 

SP 1.5         Establish Process-Performance Models

Establish and maintain the process-performance models for the organization’s set of standard processes.

Process-performance models are used to estimate or predict the value of a process-performance measure from the values of other process, product, and service measurements. These process-performance models typically use process and product measurements collected throughout the life of the project to estimate progress toward achieving objectives that cannot be measured until later in the project’s life.

The process-performance models are used as follows:

·         The organization uses them for estimating, analyzing, and predicting the process performance associated with the processes in the organization’s set of standard processes.

·         The organization uses them to assess the (potential) return on investment for process improvement activities.

·         Projects use them for estimating, analyzing, and predicting the process performance for their defined processes.

·         Projects use them for selecting processes or subprocesses for use.

These measures and models are defined to provide insight into, and to provide the ability to predict, critical process and product characteristics that are relevant to business value.
Examples of areas of concern to projects in which models may be useful include the following:

·         Schedule and cost

·         Reliability

·         Defect identification and removal rates

·         Defect removal effectiveness

·         Latent defect estimation

·         Response time

·         Project progress

·         Combinations of these areas

 

Examples of process-performance models include the following:

·         System dynamics models

·         Reliability growth models

·         Complexity models

 

Refer to the Quantitative Project Management process area for more information about the use of process-performance models.

Typical Work Products

[Organizational Training]()

A Process Management Process Area at Maturity Level 3

Purpose

The purpose of Organizational Training (OT) is to develop the skills and knowledge of people so they can perform their roles effectively and efficiently.

Introductory Notes

Organizational Training includes training to support the organization’s strategic business objectives and to meet the tactical training needs that are common across projects and support groups. Specific training needs identified by individual projects and support groups are handled at the project and support group level and are outside the scope of Organizational Training. Project and support groups are responsible for identifying and addressing their specific training needs.

Refer to the Project Planning process area for more information about the specific training needs identified by projects.

An organizational training program involves the following:

·         Identifying the training needed by the organization

·         Obtaining and providing training to address those needs

·         Establishing and maintaining training capability

·         Establishing and maintaining training records

·         Assessing training effectiveness

Effective training requires assessment of needs, planning, instructional design, and appropriate training media (e.g., workbooks and computer software), as well as a repository of training process data. As an organizational process, the main components of training include a managed training development program, documented plans, personnel with appropriate mastery of specific disciplines and other areas of knowledge, and mechanisms for measuring the effectiveness of the training program.

The identification of process training needs is primarily based on the skills that are required to perform the organization’s set of standard processes.

Refer to the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about the organization’s set of standard processes.

Certain skills may be effectively and efficiently imparted through vehicles other than in-class training experiences (e.g., informal mentoring). Other skills require more formalized training vehicles, such as in a classroom, by Web-based training, through guided self-study, or via a formalized on-the-job training program. The formal or informal training vehicles employed for each situation should be based on an assessment of the need for training and the performance gap to be addressed. The term “training” used throughout this process area is used broadly to include all of these learning options.

Success in training can be measured in terms of the availability of opportunities to acquire the skills and knowledge needed to perform new and ongoing enterprise activities.

Skills and knowledge may be technical, organizational, or contextual. Technical skills pertain to the ability to use the equipment, tools, materials, data, and processes required by a project or a process. Organizational skills pertain to behavior within and according to the employee’s organization structure, role and responsibilities, and general operating principles and methods. Contextual skills are the self-management, communication, and interpersonal abilities needed to successfully perform in the organizational and social context of the project and support groups.

The phrase “project and support groups” is used frequently in the text of the process area description to indicate an organization-level perspective.
Related Process Areas

Refer to the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about the organization’s process assets.

Refer to the Project Planning process area for more information about the specific training needs identified by projects.

Refer to the Decision Analysis and Resolution process area for how to apply decision-making criteria when determining training approaches.

SP 2.3       Assess Training Effectiveness

 
Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Establish an Organizational Training Capability

A training capability, which supports the organization's management and technical roles, is established and maintained.

The organization identifies the training required to develop the skills and the knowledge necessary to perform enterprise activities. Once the needs are identified, a training program addressing those needs is developed.

 
IPPD Addition

Cross-functional training, leadership training, interpersonal skills training, and training in the skills needed to integrate appropriate business and technical functions is needed by integrated team members. The potentially wider range of requirements and participant backgrounds may require relevant stakeholders who were not involved in requirements development to take cross training in the disciplines involved in product design in order to commit to requirements with a full understanding of the range of requirements and their interrelationships.

 

SP 1.1         Establish the Strategic Training Needs

Establish and maintain the strategic training needs of the organization.

Strategic training needs address long-term objectives to build a capability by filling significant knowledge gaps, introducing new technologies, or implementing major changes in behavior. Strategic planning typically looks two to five years into the future.
Examples of sources of strategic training needs include the following:

·         Organization’s standard processes

·         Organization’s strategic business plan

·         Organization’s process improvement plan

·         Enterprise-level initiatives

·         Skill assessments

·         Risk analyses

 

 
IPPD Addition

IPPD requires leadership and interpersonal skills beyond those typically found in traditional development environments. Specific skills emphasized in an IPPD environment include the following:

·       The ability to integrate all appropriate business and technical functions and their processes

·       The ability to coordinate and collaborate with others

 

 

Typical Work Products

1.    Training needs

2.    Assessment analysis

Subpractices

1.    Analyze the organization’s strategic business objectives and process improvement plan to identify potential future training needs.

2.    Document the strategic training needs of the organization.
Examples of categories of training needs include (but are not limited to) the following:

·       Process analysis and documentation

·       Engineering (e.g., requirements analysis, design, testing, configuration management, and quality assurance)

·       Service delivery

·       Selection and management of suppliers

·       Management (e.g., estimating, tracking, and risk management)

·       Disaster recovery and continuity of operations

 

3.    Determine the roles and skills needed to perform the organization’s set of standard processes.

4.    Document the training needed to perform the roles in the organization’s set of standard processes.

6.    Revise the organization’s strategic needs and required training as necessary.
SP 1.2         Determine Which Training Needs Are the Responsibility of the Organization

Determine which training needs are the responsibility of the organization and which will be left to the individual project or support group.

Refer to the Project Planning process area for more information about project- and support-group-specific plans for training.

In addition to strategic training needs, organizational training addresses training requirements that are common across projects and support groups. Projects and support groups have the primary responsibility for identifying and addressing their specific training needs. The organization’s training staff is only responsible for addressing common cross-project and support group training needs (e.g., training in work environments common to multiple projects). In some cases, however, the organization’s training staff may address additional training needs of projects and support groups, as negotiated with them, within the context of the training resources available and the organization’s training priorities.

Typical Work Products

1.    Common project and support group training needs

2.    Training commitments

Subpractices

1.    Analyze the training needs identified by the various projects and support groups.

Analysis of project and support group needs is intended to identify common training needs that can be most efficiently addressed organization-wide. These needs-analysis activities are used to anticipate future training needs that are first visible at the project and support group level.

2.    Negotiate with the various projects and support groups on how their specific training needs will be satisfied.

The support provided by the organization’s training staff depends on the training resources available and the organization’s training priorities.
Examples of training appropriately performed by the project or support group include the following:

·       Training in the application or service domain of the project

·       Training in the unique tools and methods used by the project or support group

·       Training in safety, security, and human factors

 

3.    Document the commitments for providing training support to the projects and support groups.
SP 1.3         Establish an Organizational Training Tactical Plan

Establish and maintain an organizational training tactical plan.

The organizational training tactical plan is the plan to deliver the training that is the responsibility of the organization and is necessary for individuals to perform their roles effectively. This plan addresses the near-term execution of training and is adjusted periodically in response to changes (e.g., in needs or resources) and to evaluations of effectiveness.

Typical Work Products

1.    Organizational training tactical plan

Subpractices

1.    Establish plan content.

Organizational training tactical plans typically contain the following:

·       Training needs

·       Training topics

Subpractices

1.    Select the appropriate approaches to satisfy specific organizational training needs.

Many factors may affect the selection of training approaches, including audience-specific knowledge, costs and schedule, work environment, and so on. Selection of an approach requires consideration of the means to provide skills and knowledge in the most effective way possible given the constraints.
Examples of training approaches include the following:

·       Classroom training

·       Computer-aided instruction

·       Guided self-study

·       Formal apprenticeship and mentoring programs

·       Facilitated videos

·       Chalk talks

·       Brown-bag lunch seminars

·       Structured on-the-job training

 

2.    Determine whether to develop training materials internally or acquire them externally.

Determine the costs and benefits of internal training development or of obtaining training externally.
Example criteria that can be used to determine the most effective mode of knowledge or skill acquisition include the following:

·       Performance objectives

·       Time available to prepare for project execution

·       Business objectives

·       Availability of in-house expertise

·       Availability of training from external sources

 

Examples of external sources of training include the following:

·       Customer-provided training

·       Commercially available training courses

·       Academic programs

·       Professional conferences

·       Seminars

 

3.    Develop or obtain training materials.

Training may be provided by the project, by support groups, by the organization, or by an external organization. The organization’s training staff coordinates the acquisition and delivery of training regardless of its source.
Examples of training materials include the following:

·       Courses

·       Computer-aided instruction

·       Videos

 

4.    Develop or obtain qualified instructors.

To ensure that internally provided training instructors have the necessary knowledge and training skills, criteria can be defined to identify, develop, and qualify them. In the case of externally provided training, the organization’s training staff can investigate how the training provider determines which instructors will deliver the training. This can also be a factor in selecting or continuing to use a specific training provider.

5.    Describe the training in the organization's training curriculum.
Examples of the information provided in the training descriptions for each course include the following:

·       Topics covered in the training

·       Intended audience

·       Prerequisites and preparation for participating

·       Training objectives

·       Length of the training

·       Lesson plans

·       Completion criteria for the course

·       Criteria for granting training waivers

 

6.    Revise the training materials and supporting artifacts as necessary.
Examples of situations in which the training materials and supporting artifacts may need to be revised include the following:

·       Training needs change (e.g., when new technology associated with the training topic is available)

·       An evaluation of the training identifies the need for change (e.g., evaluations of training effectiveness surveys, training program performance assessments, or instructor evaluation forms)

SG 2            Provide Necessary Training

Training necessary for individuals to perform their roles effectively is provided.

In selecting people to be trained, the following should be taken into consideration:

·         Background of the target population of training participants

·         Prerequisite background to receive training

·         Skills and abilities needed by people to perform their roles

·         Need for cross-discipline technical management training for all disciplines, including project management

·         Need for managers to have training in appropriate organizational processes

·         Need for training in the basic principles of all appropriate disciplines to support personnel in quality management, configuration management, and other related support functions

·         Need to provide competency development for critical functional areas

·         Need to maintain the competencies and qualifications of personnel to operate and maintain work environments common to multiple projects
SP 2.1         Deliver Training

Deliver the training following the organizational training tactical plan.

Typical Work Products

1.    Delivered training course

Subpractices

1.    Select the people who will receive the training necessary to perform their roles effectively.

Training is intended to impart knowledge and skills to people performing various roles within the organization. Some people already possess the knowledge and skills required to perform well in their designated roles. Training can be waived for these people, but care should be taken that training waivers are not abused.

2.    Schedule the training, including any resources, as necessary (e.g., facilities and instructors).

Training should be planned and scheduled. Training is provided that has a direct bearing on the expectations of work performance. Therefore, optimal training occurs in a timely manner with regard to imminent job-performance expectations. These expectations often include the following:

·       Training in the use of specialized tools

·       Training in procedures that are new to the individual who will perform them

3.    Conduct the training.

Experienced instructors should perform training. When possible, training is conducted in settings that closely resemble actual performance conditions and includes activities to simulate actual work situations. This approach includes integration of tools, methods, and procedures for competency development. Training is tied to work responsibilities so that on-the-job activities or other outside experiences will reinforce the training within a reasonable time after the training.

4.    Track the delivery of training against the plan.
SP 2.2         Establish Training Records

Establish and maintain records of the organizational training.

Refer to the Project Monitoring and Control process area for information about how project or support group training records are maintained.

The scope of this practice is for the training performed at the organizational level. Establishment and maintenance of training records for project- or support-group-sponsored training is the responsibility of each individual project or support group.

Typical Work Products

1.    Training records

2.    Training updates to the organizational repository

Subpractices

1.    Keep records of all students who successfully complete each training course or other approved training activity as well as those who are unsuccessful.

2.    Keep records of all staff who have been waived from specific training.

The rationale for granting a waiver should be documented, and both the manager responsible and the manager of the excepted individual should approve the waiver for organizational training.

3.    Keep records of all students who successfully complete their designated required training.

4.    Make training records available to the appropriate people for consideration in assignments.

Training records may be part of a skills matrix developed by the training organization to provide a summary of the experience and education of people, as well as training sponsored by the organization.
SP 2.3         Assess Training Effectiveness

Assess the effectiveness of the organization’s training program.

A process should exist to determine the effectiveness of training (i.e., how well the training is meeting the organization’s needs).
Examples of methods used to assess training effectiveness include the following:

·         Testing in the training context

·         Post-training surveys of training participants

·         Surveys of managers’ satisfaction with post-training effects

·         Assessment mechanisms embedded in courseware

 

Measures may be taken to assess the benefit of the training against both the project’s and organization’s objectives. Particular attention should be paid to the need for various training methods, such as training teams as integral work units. When used, performance objectives should be shared with course participants, and should be unambiguous, observable, and verifiable. The results of the training-effectiveness assessment should be used to revise training materials as described in the Establish Training Capability specific practice.

Typical Work Products

1.    Training-effectiveness surveys

2.    Training program performance assessments

3.    Instructor evaluation forms

4.    Training examinations

Subpractices

1.    Assess in-progress or completed projects to determine whether staff knowledge is adequate for performing project tasks.

[Product Integration]()

An Engineering Process Area at Maturity Level 3

Purpose

The purpose of Product Integration (PI) is to assemble the product from the product components, ensure that the product, as integrated, functions properly, and deliver the product.

Introductory Notes

This process area addresses the integration of product components into more complex product components or into complete products.

The scope of this process area is to achieve complete product integration through progressive assembly of product components, in one stage or in incremental stages, according to a defined integration sequence and procedures. Throughout the process areas, where we use the terms product and product component, their intended meanings also encompass services and their components.

A critical aspect of product integration is the management of internal and external interfaces of the products and product components to ensure compatibility among the interfaces. Attention should be paid to interface management throughout the project.

Product integration is more than just a one-time assembly of the product components at the conclusion of design and fabrication. Product integration can be conducted incrementally, using an iterative process of assembling product components, evaluating them, and then assembling more product components. This process may begin with analysis and simulations (e.g., threads, rapid prototypes, virtual prototypes, and physical prototypes) and steadily progress through increasingly more realistic incremental functionality until the final product is achieved. In each successive build, prototypes (virtual, rapid, or physical) are constructed, evaluated, improved, and reconstructed based on knowledge gained in the evaluation process. The degree of virtual versus physical prototyping required depends on the functionality of the design tools, the complexity of the product, and its associated risk. There is a high probability that the product, integrated in this manner, will pass product verification and validation. For some products and services, the last integration phase will occur when they are deployed at the intended operational site.
Related Process Areas

Refer to the Requirements Development process area for more information about identifying interface requirements.

Refer to the Technical Solution process area for more information about defining the interfaces and the integration environment (when the integration environment needs to be developed).

Refer to the Verification process area for more information about verifying the interfaces, the integration environment, and the progressively assembled product components.

Refer to the Validation process area for more information about performing validation of the product components and the integrated product.

Refer to the Risk Management process area for more information about identifying risks and the use of prototypes in risk mitigation for both interface compatibility and product component integration.

Refer to the Decision Analysis and Resolution process area for more information about using a formal evaluation process for selecting the appropriate integration sequence and procedures and for deciding whether the integration environment should be acquired or developed.

Refer to the Configuration Management process area for more information about managing changes to interface definitions and about the distribution of information.

SG 1            Prepare for Product Integration

Preparation for product integration is conducted.

Preparing for integration of product components involves establishing and maintaining an integration sequence, the environment for performing the integration, and integration procedures. The specific practices of the Prepare for Product Integration specific goal build on each other in the following way. The first specific practice determines the sequence for product and product component integration. The second determines the environment that will be used to carry out the product and product component integration. The third develops procedures and criteria for product and product component integration. Preparation for integration starts early in the project and the integration sequence is developed concurrently with the practices in the Technical Solution process area.
SP 1.1         Determine Integration Sequence

Determine the product component integration sequence.

The product components that are integrated may include those that are a part of the product to be delivered along with test equipment, test software, or other integration items such as fixtures. Once you have analyzed alternative test and assembly integration sequences, select the best integration sequence.

The product integration sequence can provide for incremental assembly and evaluation of product components that provide a problem-free foundation for incorporation of other product components as they become available, or for prototypes of high-risk product components.

The integration sequence should be harmonized with the selection of solutions and the design of product and product components in the Technical Solution process area.

Refer to the Decision Analysis and Resolution process area for more information about using a formal evaluation process to select the appropriate product integration sequence.

Refer to the Risk Management process area for more information about identifying and handling risks associated with the integration sequence.

Refer to the Supplier Agreement Management process area for more information about transitioning acquired product components and the need for handling those product components in the product integration sequence.

Typical Work Products

1.    Product integration sequence

2.    Rationale for selecting or rejecting integration sequences

Subpractices

1.    Identify the product components to be integrated.

2.    Identify the verifications to be performed during the integration of the product components.

3.    Identify alternative product component integration sequences.

This can include defining the specific tools and test equipment to support the product integration.

4.    Select the best integration sequence.

5.    Periodically review the product integration sequence and revise as needed.

Assess the product integration sequence to ensure that variations in production and delivery schedules have not had an adverse impact on the sequence or compromised the factors on which earlier decisions were made.

6.    Record the rationale for decisions made and deferred.
SP 1.2         Establish the Product Integration Environment

Establish and maintain the environment needed to support the integration of the product components.

Refer to the Technical Solution process area for more information about make-or-buy decisions.

The environment for product integration can either be acquired or developed. To establish an environment, requirements for the purchase or development of equipment, software, or other resources will need to be developed. These requirements are gathered when implementing the processes associated with the Requirements Development process area. The product integration environment may include the reuse of existing organizational resources. The decision to acquire or develop the product integration environment is addressed in the processes associated with the Technical Solution process area.

The environment required at each step of the product integration process may include test equipment, simulators (taking the place of unavailable product components), pieces of real equipment, and recording devices.

Typical Work Products

1.    Verified environment for product integration

2.    Support documentation for the product integration environment

Subpractices

1.    Identify the requirements for the product integration environment.

2.    Identify verification criteria and procedures for the product integration environment.

3.    Decide whether to make or buy the needed product integration environment.

Refer to the Supplier Agreement Management process area for more information about acquiring parts of the integration environment.

4.    Develop an integration environment if a suitable environment cannot be acquired.

For unprecedented, complex projects, the product integration environment can be a major development. As such, it would involve project planning, requirements development, technical solutions, verification, validation, and risk management.

5.    Maintain the product integration environment throughout the project.

6.    Dispose of those portions of the environment that are no longer useful.
SP 1.3         Establish Product Integration Procedures and Criteria

Establish and maintain procedures and criteria for integration of the product components.

Procedures for the integration of the product components can include such things as the number of incremental iterations to be performed and details of the expected tests and other evaluations to be carried out at each stage.

Criteria can indicate the readiness of a product component for integration or its acceptability.

Procedures and criteria for product integration address the following:

·         Level of testing for build components

·         Verification of interfaces

·         Thresholds of performance deviation

·         Derived requirements for the assembly and its external interfaces

·         Allowable substitutions of components

·         Testing environment parameters

·         Limits on cost of testing

·         Quality/cost tradeoffs for integration operations

·         Probability of proper functioning

·         Delivery rate and its variation

·         Lead time from order to delivery

·         Personnel availability

·         Availability of the integration facility/line/environment

Criteria can be defined for how the product components are to be verified and the functions they are expected to have. Criteria can be defined for how the assembled product components and final integrated product are to be validated and delivered.

Criteria may also constrain the degree of simulation permitted for a product component to pass a test, or may constrain the environment to be used for the integration test.

Pertinent parts of the schedule and criteria for assembly should be shared with suppliers of work products to reduce the occurrence of delays and component failure

Refer to the Supplier Agreement Management process area for more information about communicating with suppliers

Typical Work Products

1.    Product integration procedures

2.    Product integration criteria

Subpractices

1.    Establish and maintain product integration procedures for the product components.

2.    Establish and maintain criteria for product component integration and evaluation.

3.    Establish and maintain criteria for validation and delivery of the integrated product.
SG 2            Ensure Interface Compatibility

The product component interfaces, both internal and external, are compatible.

Many product integration problems arise from unknown or uncontrolled aspects of both internal and external interfaces. Effective management of product component interface requirements, specifications, and designs helps ensure that implemented interfaces will be complete and compatible.
SP 2.1         Review Interface Descriptions for Completeness

Review interface descriptions for coverage and completeness.

The interfaces should include, in addition to product component interfaces, all the interfaces with the product integration environment.

Typical Work Products

1.    Categories of interfaces

2.    List of interfaces per category

3.    Mapping of the interfaces to the product components and the product integration environment

Subpractices

1.    Review interface data for completeness and ensure complete coverage of all interfaces.

Consider all the product components and prepare a relationship table. Interfaces are usually classified in three main classes: environmental, physical, and functional. Typical categories for these classes include the following: mechanical, fluid, sound, electrical, climatic, electromagnetic, thermal, message, and the human-machine or human interface.
Examples of interfaces (e.g., for mechanical or electronic components) that may be classified within these three classes include the following:

·       Mechanical interfaces (e.g., weight and size, center of gravity, clearance of parts in operation, space required for maintenance, fixed links, mobile links, and shocks and vibrations received from the bearing structure)

·       Noise interfaces (e.g., noise transmitted by the structure, noise transmitted in the air, and acoustics)

·       Climatic interfaces (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure, and salinity)

·       Thermal interfaces (e.g., heat dissipation, transmission of heat to the bearing structure, and air conditioning characteristics)

·       Fluid interfaces (e.g., fresh water inlet/outlet, seawater inlet/outlet for a naval/coastal product, air conditioning, compressed air, nitrogen, fuel, lubricating oil, and exhaust gas outlet)

·       Electrical interfaces (e.g., power supply consumption by network with transients and peak values; nonsensitive control signal for power supply and communications; sensitive signal [e.g., analog links]; disturbing signal [e.g., microwave]; and grounding signal to comply with the TEMPEST standard)

·       Electromagnetic interfaces (e.g., magnetic field, radio and radar links, optical band link wave guides, and coaxial and optical fibers)

·       Human-machine interface (e.g., audio or voice synthesis, audio or voice recognition, display [analog dial, television screen, or liquid-crystal display, indicators' light-emitting diodes], and manual controls [pedal, joystick, ball, keys, push buttons, or touch screen])

·       Message interfaces (e.g., origination, destination, stimulus, protocols, and data characteristics)

 

2.    Ensure that product components and interfaces are marked to ensure easy and correct connection to the joining product component.

3.    Periodically review the adequacy of interface descriptions.

Once established, the interface descriptions must be periodically reviewed to ensure there is no deviation between the existing descriptions and the products being developed, processed, produced, or bought.

The interface descriptions for product components should be reviewed with relevant stakeholders to avoid misinterpretations, reduce delays, and prevent the development of interfaces that do not work properly.
SP 2.2         Manage Interfaces

Manage internal and external interface definitions, designs, and changes for products and product components.

Interface requirements drive the development of the interfaces necessary to integrate product components. Managing product and product component interfaces starts very early in the development of the product. The definitions and designs for interfaces affect not only the product components and external systems, but can also affect the verification and validation environments.

Refer to the Requirements Development process area for more information about requirements for interfaces.

Refer to the Technical Solution process area for more information about design of interfaces between product components.

Refer to the Requirements Management process area for more information about managing the changes to the interface requirements.

Refer to the Configuration Management process area for more information about distributing changes to the interface descriptions (specifications) so that everyone can know the current state of the interfaces.

Management of the interfaces includes maintenance of the consistency of the interfaces throughout the life of the product, and resolution of conflict, noncompliance, and change issues. The management of interfaces between products acquired from suppliers and other products or product components is critical for success of the project.

Refer to the Supplier Agreement Management process area for more information about managing suppliers.

The interfaces should include, in addition to product component interfaces, all the interfaces with the environment as well as other environments for verification, validation, operations, and support.

The interface changes are documented, maintained, and readily accessible.

Typical Work Products

1.    Table of relationships among the product components and the external environment (e.g., main power supply, fastening product, and computer bus system)

2.    Table of relationships among the different product components

3.    List of agreed-to interfaces defined for each pair of product components, when applicable

4.    Reports from the interface control working group meetings

5.    Action items for updating interfaces

6.    Application program interface (API)

7.    Updated interface description or agreement

Subpractices

1.    Ensure the compatibility of the interfaces throughout the life of the product.

2.    Resolve conflict, noncompliance, and change issues.

3.    Maintain a repository for interface data accessible to project participants.

A common accessible repository for interface data provides a mechanism to ensure that everyone knows where the current interface data resides and can access it for use.
SG 3            Assemble Product Components and Deliver the Product

Verified product components are assembled and the integrated, verified, and validated product is delivered.

Integration of product components proceeds according to the product integration sequence and available procedures. Before integration, each product component should be confirmed to be compliant with its interface requirements. Product components are assembled into larger, more complex product components. These assembled product components are checked for correct interoperation. This process continues until product integration is complete. If, during this process, problems are identified, the problem should be documented and a corrective action process initiated.

Ensure that the assembly of the product components into larger and more complex product components is conducted according to the product integration sequence and available procedures. The timely receipt of needed product components and the involvement of the right people contribute to the successful integration of the product components that compose the product.
SP 3.1         Confirm Readiness of Product Components for Integration

Confirm, prior to assembly, that each product component required to assemble the product has been properly identified, functions according to its description, and that the product component interfaces comply with the interface descriptions.

Refer to the Verification process area for more information about verifying product components.

Refer to the Technical Solution process area for more information about unit test of product components.

The purpose of this specific practice is to ensure that the properly identified product component that meets its description can actually be assembled according to the product integration sequence and available procedures. The product components are checked for quantity, obvious damage, and consistency between the product component and interface descriptions.

Those conducting product integration are ultimately responsible for checking to make sure everything is proper with the product components before assembly.

Typical Work Products

1.    Acceptance documents for the received product components

2.    Delivery receipts

3.    Checked packing lists

4.    Exception reports

5.    Waivers

Subpractices

1.    Track the status of all product components as soon as they become available for integration.

2.    Ensure that product components are delivered to the product integration environment in accordance with the product integration sequence and available procedures.

3.    Confirm the receipt of each properly identified product component.

4.    Ensure that each received product component meets its description.

5.    Check the configuration status against the expected configuration.

6.    Perform a pre-check (e.g., by a visual inspection and using basic measures) of all the physical interfaces before connecting product components together.
SP 3.2         Assemble Product Components

Assemble product components according to the product integration sequence and available procedures.

The assembly activities of this specific practice and the evaluation activities of the next specific practice are conducted iteratively, from the initial product components, through the interim assemblies of product components, to the product as a whole.

Typical Work Products

1.    Assembled product or product components

Subpractices

1.    Ensure the readiness of the product integration environment.

2.    Ensure that the assembly sequence is properly performed.

Record all appropriate information (e.g., configuration status, serial numbers of the product components, types, and calibration date of the meters).

3.    Revise the product integration sequence and available procedures as appropriate.
SP 3.3         Evaluate Assembled Product Components

Evaluate assembled product components for interface compatibility.

Refer to the Verification process area for more information about verifying assembled product components.

Refer to the Validation process area for more information about validating assembled product components.

This evaluation involves examining and testing assembled product components for performance, suitability, or readiness using the available procedures and environment. It is performed as appropriate for different stages of assembly of product components as identified in the product integration sequence and available procedures. The product integration sequence and available procedures may define a more refined integration and evaluation sequence than might be envisioned just by examining the product architecture. For example, if an assembly of product components is composed of four less complex product components, the integration sequence will not necessarily call for the simultaneous integration and evaluation of the four units as one. Rather, the four less complex units may be integrated progressively, one at a time, with an evaluation after each assembly operation prior to realizing the more complex product component that matched the specification in the product architecture. Alternatively, the product integration sequence and available procedures could have determined that only a final evaluation was the best one to perform.

Typical Work Products

1.    Exception reports

2.    Interface evaluation reports

3.    Product integration summary reports

Subpractices

1.    Conduct the evaluation of assembled product components following the product integration sequence and available procedures.

2.    Record the evaluation results.
Example results include the following:

·       Any adaptation required to the integration procedure

·       Any change to the product configuration (spare parts, new release)

·       Evaluation procedure deviations

 

SP 3.4         Package and Deliver the Product or Product Component

Package the assembled product or product component and deliver it to the appropriate customer.

Refer to the Verification process area for more information about verifying the product or an assembly of product components before packaging.

Refer to the Validation process area for more information about validating the product or an assembly of product components before packaging.

The packaging requirements for some products can be addressed in their specifications and verification criteria. This is especially important when items are stored and transported by the customer. In such cases, there may be a spectrum of environmental and stress conditions specified for the package. In other circumstances, factors such as the following may become important:

·         Economy and ease of transportation (e.g., containerization)

·         Accountability (e.g., shrink wrapping)

·         Ease and safety of unpacking (e.g., sharp edges, strength of binding methods, childproofing, environmental friendliness of packing material, and weight)

The adjustment required to fit product components together in the factory could be different from the one required to fit product components together when installed on the operational site. In that case, the product’s logbook for the customer should be used to record such specific parameters.

Typical Work Products

1.    Packaged product or product components

2.    Delivery documentation

Subpractices

1.    Review the requirements, design, product, verification results, and documentation to ensure that issues affecting the packaging and delivery of the product are identified and resolved.

2.    Use effective methods to package and deliver the assembled product.

For Software Engineering
Examples of software packaging and delivery methods include the following:

· Magnetic tape

· Diskettes

· Hardcopy documents

· Compact disks

· Other electronic distribution such as the Internet

 

 

3.    Satisfy the applicable requirements and standards for packaging and delivering the product.
Examples of requirements and standards include those for safety, the environment, security, transportability, and disposal.

 

For Software Engineering
Examples of requirements and standards for packaging and delivering software include the following:

· Type of storage and delivery media

· Custodians of the master and backup copies

[Project Monitoring and Control]()

A Project Management Process Area at Maturity Level 2

Purpose

The purpose of Project Monitoring and Control (PMC) is to provide an understanding of the project’s progress so that appropriate corrective actions can be taken when the project’s performance deviates significantly from the plan.

Introductory Notes

A project’s documented plan is the basis for monitoring activities, communicating status, and taking corrective action. Progress is primarily determined by comparing actual work product and task attributes, effort, cost, and schedule to the plan at prescribed milestones or control levels within the project schedule or work breakdown structure (WBS). Appropriate visibility enables timely corrective action to be taken when performance deviates significantly from the plan. A deviation is significant if, when left unresolved, it precludes the project from meeting its objectives.

The term “project plan” is used throughout these practices to refer to the overall plan for controlling the project.

When actual status deviates significantly from the expected values, corrective actions are taken as appropriate. These actions may require replanning, which may include revising the original plan, establishing new agreements, or including additional mitigation activities within the current plan.
Related Process Areas

Refer to the Project Planning process area for more information about the project plan, including how it specifies the appropriate level of project monitoring, the measures used to monitor progress, and known risks.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for information about the process of measuring, analyzing, and recording information.

[Project Planning]()

A Project Management Process Area at Maturity Level 2

Purpose

The purpose of Project Planning (PP) is to establish and maintain plans that define project activities.

Introductory Notes

The Project Planning process area involves the following:

·         Developing the project plan

·         Interacting with stakeholders appropriately

·         Getting commitment to the plan

·         Maintaining the plan

Planning begins with requirements that define the product and project.

Planning includes estimating the attributes of the work products and tasks, determining the resources needed, negotiating commitments, producing a schedule, and identifying and analyzing project risks. Iterating through these activities may be necessary to establish the project plan. The project plan provides the basis for performing and controlling the project’s activities that address the commitments with the project’s customer.

The project plan will usually need to be revised as the project progresses to address changes in requirements and commitments, inaccurate estimates, corrective actions, and process changes. Specific practices describing both planning and replanning are contained in this process area.

The term “project plan” is used throughout the generic and specific practices in this process area to refer to the overall plan for controlling the project.
Related Process Areas

Refer to the Requirements Development process area for more information about developing requirements that define the product and product components. Product and product component requirements and changes to those requirements serve as a basis for planning and replanning.

Refer to the Requirements Management process area for more information about managing requirements needed for planning and replanning.

Refer to the Risk Management process area for more information about identifying and managing risks.

Refer to the Technical Solution process area for more information about transforming requirements into product and product component solutions.

Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Establish Estimates

Estimates of project planning parameters are established and maintained.

Project planning parameters include all information needed by the project to perform the necessary planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting, and budgeting.

Estimates of planning parameters should have a sound basis to instill confidence that any plans based on these estimates are capable of supporting project objectives.

Factors that are typically considered when estimating these parameters include the following:

·         Project requirements, including the product requirements, the requirements imposed by the organization, the requirements imposed by the customer, and other requirements that impact the project

·         Scope of the project

·         Identified tasks and work products

·         Technical approach

·         Selected project lifecycle model (e.g., waterfall, incremental, or spiral)

·         Attributes of the work products and tasks (e.g., size or complexity)

·         Schedule

·         Models or historical data for converting the attributes of the work products and tasks into labor hours and cost

·         Methodology (e.g., models, data, algorithms) used to determine needed material, skills, labor hours, and cost

Documentation of the estimating rationale and supporting data is needed for stakeholders’ review and commitment to the plan and for maintenance of the plan as the project progresses.
SP 1.1         Estimate the Scope of the Project

Establish a top-level work breakdown structure (WBS) to estimate the scope of the project.

The WBS evolves with the project. Initially a top-level WBS can serve to structure the initial estimating. The development of a WBS divides the overall project into an interconnected set of manageable components. Typically, the WBS is a product oriented structure that provides a scheme for identifying and organizing the logical units of work to be managed, which are called “work packages.” The WBS provides a reference and organizational mechanism for assigning effort, schedule, and responsibility and is used as the underlying framework to plan, organize, and control the work done on the project. Some projects use the term “contract WBS” to refer to the portion of the WBS placed under contract (possibly the entire WBS). Not all projects have a contract WBS (e.g., internally funded development).

Typical Work Products

1.    Task descriptions

2.    Work package descriptions

3.    WBS

Subpractices

1.    Develop a WBS based on the product architecture.

The WBS provides a scheme for organizing the project’s work around the product and product components that the work supports. The WBS should permit the identification of the following items:

·       Identified risks and their mitigation tasks

·       Tasks for deliverables and supporting activities

·       Tasks for skill and knowledge acquisition

·       Tasks for development of needed support plans, such as configuration management, quality assurance, and verification plans

·       Tasks for integration and management of nondevelopmental items

2.    Identify the work packages in sufficient detail to specify estimates of project tasks, responsibilities, and schedule.

The top-level WBS is intended to help in gauging the project work effort in terms of tasks and organizational roles and responsibilities. The amount of detail in the WBS at this more detailed level helps in developing realistic schedules, thereby minimizing the need for management reserve.

3.    Identify product or product components that will be externally acquired.

Refer to the Supplier Agreement Management process area for more information about acquiring products from sources external to the project.

4.    Identify work products that will be reused.
SP 1.2         Establish Estimates of Work Product and Task Attributes

Establish and maintain estimates of the attributes of the work products and tasks.

Size is the primary input to many models used to estimate effort, cost, and schedule. The models can also be based on inputs such as connectivity, complexity, and structure.
Examples of types of work products for which size estimates are made include the following:

·         Deliverable and nondeliverable work products

·         Documents and files

·         Operational and support hardware, firmware, and software

 

Examples of size measures include the following:

·         Number of functions

·         Function points

·         Source lines of code

·         Number of classes and objects

·         Number of requirements

·         Number and complexity of interfaces

·         Number of pages

·         Number of inputs and outputs

·         Number of technical risk items

·         Volume of data

·         Number of logic gates for integrated circuits

·         Number of parts (e.g., printed circuit boards, components, and mechanical parts)

·         Physical constraints (e.g., weight and volume)

 

The estimates should be consistent with project requirements to determine the project’s effort, cost, and schedule. A relative level of difficulty or complexity should be assigned for each size attribute.

Typical Work Products

1.    Technical approach

2.    Size and complexity of tasks and work products

3.    Estimating models

4.    Attribute estimates

Subpractices

1.    Determine the technical approach for the project.

The technical approach defines a top-level strategy for development of the product. It includes decisions on architectural features, such as distributed or client/server; state-of-the-art or established technologies to be applied, such as robotics, composite materials, or artificial intelligence; and breadth of the functionality expected in the final products, such as safety, security, and ergonomics.

2.    Use appropriate methods to determine the attributes of the work products and tasks that will be used to estimate the resource requirements.

Methods for determining size and complexity should be based on validated models or historical data.

The methods for determining attributes evolve as our understanding of the relationship of product characteristics to attributes increases.
Examples of current methods include the following:

·       Number of logic gates for integrated circuit design

·       Lines of code or function points for software

·       Number/complexity of requirements for systems engineering

·       Number of square feet for standard-specified residential homes

 

3.    Estimate the attributes of the work products and tasks.
SP 1.3         Define Project Lifecycle

Define the project lifecycle phases on which to scope the planning effort.

The determination of a project’s lifecycle phases provides for planned periods of evaluation and decision making. These are normally defined to support logical decision points at which significant commitments are made concerning resources and technical approach. Such points provide planned events at which project course corrections and determinations of future scope and cost can be made.

The project lifecycle phases need to be defined depending on the scope of requirements, the estimates for project resources, and the nature of the project. Larger projects may contain multiple phases, such as concept exploration, development, production, operations, and disposal. Within these phases, subphases may be needed. A development phase may include subphases such as requirements analysis, design, fabrication, integration, and verification. The determination of project phases typically includes selection and refinement of one or more development models to address interdependencies and appropriate sequencing of the activities in the phases.

Depending on the strategy for development, there may be intermediate phases for the creation of prototypes, increments of capability, or spiral model cycles.

Understanding the project lifecycle is crucial in determining the scope of the planning effort and the timing of the initial planning, as well as the timing and criteria (critical milestones) for replanning.

Typical Work Products

1.    Project lifecycle phases
SP 1.4         Determine Estimates of Effort and Cost

Estimate the project effort and cost for the work products and tasks based on estimation rationale.

Estimates of effort and cost are generally based on the results of analysis using models or historical data applied to size, activities, and other planning parameters. Confidence in these estimates is based on the rationale for the selected model and the nature of the data. There may be occasions when the available historical data does not apply, such as where efforts are unprecedented or where the type of task does not fit available models. An effort is unprecedented (to some degree) if a similar product or component has never been built. An effort may also be unprecedented if the development group has never built such a product or component.

Unprecedented efforts are more risky, require more research to develop reasonable bases of estimate, and require more management reserve. The uniqueness of the project must be documented when using these models to ensure a common understanding of any assumptions made in the initial planning stages.

Typical Work Products

1.    Estimation rationale

2.    Project effort estimates

3.    Project cost estimates

Subpractices

1.    Collect the models or historical data that will be used to transform the attributes of the work products and tasks into estimates of the labor hours and cost.

Many parametric models have been developed to aid in estimating cost and schedule. The use of these models as the sole source of estimation is not recommended because these models are based on historical project data that may or may not be pertinent to your project. Multiple models and/or methods can be used to ensure a high level of confidence in the estimate.

Historical data include the cost, effort, and schedule data from previously executed projects, plus appropriate scaling data to account for differing sizes and complexity.

2.    Include supporting infrastructure needs when estimating effort and cost.

The supporting infrastructure includes resources needed from a development and sustainment perspective for the product.

Consider the infrastructure resource needs in the development environment, the test environment, the production environment, the target environment, or any appropriate combination of these when estimating effort and cost.
Examples of infrastructure resources include the following:

·       Critical computer resources (e.g., memory, disk and network capacity, peripherals, communication channels, and the capacities of these)

·       Engineering environments and tools (e.g., tools for prototyping, assembly, computer-aided design [CAD], and simulation)

·       Facilities, machinery, and equipment (e.g., test benches and recording devices)

 

3.    Estimate effort and cost using models and/or historical data.

Effort and cost inputs used for estimating typically include the following:

·       Judgmental estimates provided by an expert or group of experts (e.g., Delphi Method)

·       Risks, including the extent to which the effort is unprecedented

·       Critical competencies and roles needed to perform the work

·       Product and product component requirements

·       Technical approach

·       WBS

·       Size estimates of work products and anticipated changes

·       Cost of externally acquired products

·       Selected project lifecycle model and processes

·       Lifecycle cost estimates

·       Capability of tools provided in engineering environment

·       Skill levels of managers and staff needed to perform the work

·       Knowledge, skill, and training needs

·       Facilities needed (e.g., office and meeting space and workstations)

·       Engineering facilities needed

·       Capability of manufacturing process(es)

·       Travel

·       Level of security required for tasks, work products, hardware, software, personnel, and work environment

·       Service level agreements for call centers and warranty work

·       Direct labor and overhead
SG 2            Develop a Project Plan

A project plan is established and maintained as the basis for managing the project.

A project plan is a formal, approved document used to manage and control the execution of the project. It is based on the project requirements and the established estimates.

The project plan should consider all phases of the project lifecycle. Project planning should ensure that all plans affecting the project are consistent with the overall project plan.
SP 2.1         Establish the Budget and Schedule

Establish and maintain the project’s budget and schedule.

The project’s budget and schedule are based on the developed estimates and ensure that budget allocation, task complexity, and task dependencies are appropriately addressed.

Event-driven, resource-limited schedules have proven to be effective in dealing with project risk. Identifying accomplishments to be demonstrated before initiation of the event provides some flexibility in the timing of the event, a common understanding of what is expected, a better vision of the state of the project, and a more accurate status of the project’s tasks.

Typical Work Products

1.    Project schedules

2.    Schedule dependencies

3.    Project budget

Subpractices

1.    Identify major milestones.

Milestones are often imposed to ensure completion of certain deliverables by the milestone. Milestones can be event based or calendar based. If calendar based, once milestone dates have been agreed on, it is often very difficult to change them.

2.    Identify schedule assumptions.

When schedules are initially developed, it is common to make assumptions about the duration of certain activities. These assumptions are frequently made on items for which little if any estimation data is available. Identifying these assumptions provides insight into the level of confidence (uncertainties) in the overall schedule.

3.    Identify constraints.

Factors that limit the flexibility of management options need to be identified as early as possible. The examination of the attributes of the work products and tasks often will bring these issues to the surface. Such attributes can include task duration, resources, inputs, and outputs.

4.    Identify task dependencies.

Typically, the tasks for a project can be accomplished in some ordered sequence that will minimize the duration of the project. This involves the identification of predecessor and successor tasks to determine the optimal ordering.
Examples of tools that can help determine an optimal ordering of task activities include the following:

·       Critical Path Method (CPM)

·       Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)

·       Resource-limited scheduling

 

5.    Define the budget and schedule.

Establishing and maintaining the project’s budget and schedule typically includes the following:

·       Defining the committed or expected availability of resources and facilities

·       Determining time phasing of activities

·       Determining a breakout of subordinate schedules

·       Defining the dependencies between the activities (predecessor or successor relationships)

·       Defining the schedule activities and milestones to support accuracy in progress measurement

·       Identifying milestones for delivery of products to the customer

·       Defining activities of appropriate duration

·       Defining milestones of appropriate time separation

·       Defining a management reserve based on the confidence level in meeting the schedule and budget

·       Using appropriate historical data to verify the schedule

·       Defining incremental funding requirements

·       Documenting project assumptions and rationale

6.    Establish corrective action criteria.

Criteria are established for determining what constitutes a significant deviation from the project plan. A basis for gauging issues and problems is necessary to determine when a corrective action should be taken. The corrective actions may require replanning, which may include revising the original plan, establishing new agreements, or including mitigation activities within the current plan.
SP 2.2         Identify Project Risks

Identify and analyze project risks.

Refer to the Risk Management process area for more information about risk management activities.

Refer to the Monitor Project Risks specific practice in the Project Monitoring and Control process area for more information about risk monitoring activities.

Risks are identified or discovered and analyzed to support project planning. This specific practice should be extended to all the plans that affect the project to ensure that the appropriate interfacing is taking place between all relevant stakeholders on identified risks. Project planning risk identification and analysis typically include the following:

·         Identifying risks

·         Analyzing the risks to determine the impact, probability of occurrence, and time frame in which problems are likely to occur

·         Prioritizing risks

Typical Work Products

1.    Identified risks

2.    Risk impacts and probability of occurrence

3.    Risk priorities

Subpractices

1.    Identify risks.

The identification of risks involves the identification of potential issues, hazards, threats, vulnerabilities, and so on that could negatively affect work efforts and plans. Risks must be identified and described in an understandable way before they can be analyzed. When identifying risks, it is a good idea to use a standard method for defining risks. Risk identification and analysis tools can be used to help identify possible problems.
Examples of risk identification and analysis tools include the following:

·       Risk taxonomies

·       Risk assessments

·       Checklists

·       Structured interviews

·       Brainstorming

·       Performance models

·       Cost models

·       Network analysis

·       Quality factor analysis

 

2.    Document the risks.

3.    Review and obtain agreement with relevant stakeholders on the completeness and correctness of the documented risks.

4.    Revise the risks as appropriate.
Examples of when identified risks may need to be revised include the following:

·       When new risks are identified

·       When risks become problems

·       When risks are retired

·       When project circumstances change significantly

 

SP 2.3         Plan for Data Management

Plan for the management of project data.

 
IPPD Addition

When integrated teams are formed, project data includes data developed and used solely within a particular team as well as data applicable across integrated team boundaries, if there are multiple integrated teams.

 

Data are the various forms of documentation required to support a program in all of its areas (e.g., administration, engineering, configuration management, finance, logistics, quality, safety, manufacturing, and procurement). The data can take any form (e.g., reports, manuals, notebooks, charts, drawings, specifications, files, or correspondence). The data may exist in any medium (e.g., printed or drawn on various materials, photographs, electronic, or multimedia). Data may be deliverable (e.g., items identified by a program’s contract data requirements) or data may be nondeliverable (e.g., informal data, trade studies and analyses, internal meeting minutes, internal design review documentation, lessons learned, and action items). Distribution can take many forms, including electronic transmission.

The data requirements for the project should be established for both the data items to be created and their content and form, based on a common or standard set of data requirements. Uniform content and format requirements for data items facilitate understanding of data content and help with consistent management of the data resources.

The reason for collecting each document should be clear. This task includes the analysis and verification of project deliverables and nondeliverables, contract and noncontract data requirements, and customer-supplied data. Often, data is collected with no clear understanding of how it will be used. Data is costly and should be collected only when needed.

Typical Work Products

1.    Data management plan

2.    Master list of managed data

3.    Data content and format description

4.    Data requirements lists for acquirers and for suppliers

5.    Privacy requirements

6.    Security requirements

7.    Security procedures

8.    Mechanism for data retrieval, reproduction, and distribution

9.    Schedule for collection of project data

10.  Listing of project data to be collected

Subpractices

1.    Establish requirements and procedures to ensure privacy and security of the data.

Not everyone will have the need or clearance necessary to access the project data. Procedures must be established to identify who has access to what data as well as when they have access to the data.

2.    Establish a mechanism to archive data and to access archived data.

Accessed information should be in an understandable form (e.g., electronic or computer output from a database) or represented as originally generated.

3.    Determine the project data to be identified, collected, and distributed.
SP 2.4         Plan for Project Resources

Plan for necessary resources to perform the project.

 
IPPD Addition

When integrated teams are formed, planning for project resources should consider staffing of the integrated teams.

 

Defining project resources (labor, machinery/equipment, materials, and methods) and quantities needed to perform project activities builds on the initial estimates and provides additional information that can be applied to expand the WBS used to manage the project.

The top-level WBS developed earlier as an estimation mechanism is typically expanded by decomposing these top levels into work packages that represent singular work units that can be separately assigned, performed, and tracked. This subdivision is done to distribute management responsibility and provide better management control. Each work package or work product in the WBS should be assigned a unique identifier (e.g., number) to permit tracking. A WBS can be based on requirements, activities, work products, or a combination of these items. A dictionary that describes the work for each work package in the WBS should accompany the work breakdown structure.

Typical Work Products

1.    WBS work packages

2.    WBS task dictionary

3.    Staffing requirements based on project size and scope

4.    Critical facilities/equipment list

5.    Process/workflow definitions and diagrams

6.    Program administration requirements list

Subpractices

1.    Determine process requirements.

The processes used to manage a project must be identified, defined, and coordinated with all the relevant stakeholders to ensure efficient operations during project execution.

2.    Determine staffing requirements.

The staffing of a project depends on the decomposition of the project requirements into tasks, roles, and responsibilities for accomplishing the project requirements as laid out within the work packages of the WBS.

Staffing requirements must consider the knowledge and skills required for each of the identified positions, as defined in the Plan for Needed Knowledge and Skills specific practice.

3.    Determine facilities, equipment, and component requirements.

Most projects are unique in some sense and require some set of unique assets to accomplish the objectives of the project. The determination and acquisition of these assets in a timely manner are crucial to project success.

Lead-time items need to be identified early to determine how they will be addressed. Even when the required assets are not unique, compiling a list of all of the facilities, equipment, and parts (e.g., number of computers for the personnel working on the project, software applications, and office space) provides insight into aspects of the scope of an effort that are often overlooked.
SP 2.5         Plan for Needed Knowledge and Skills

Plan for knowledge and skills needed to perform the project.

Refer to the Organizational Training process area for more information about knowledge and skills information to be incorporated into the project plan.

Knowledge delivery to projects involves both training of project personnel and acquisition of knowledge from outside sources.

Staffing requirements are dependent on the knowledge and skills available to support the execution of the project.

Typical Work Products

1.    Inventory of skill needs

2.    Staffing and new hire plans

3.    Databases (e.g., skills and training)

Subpractices

1.    Identify the knowledge and skills needed to perform the project.

2.    Assess the knowledge and skills available.

3.    Select mechanisms for providing needed knowledge and skills.
Example mechanisms include the following:

·       In-house training (both organizational and project)

·       External training

·       Staffing and new hires

·       External skill acquisition

 

The choice of in-house training or outsourced training for the needed knowledge and skills is determined by the availability of training expertise, the project’s schedule, and the business objectives.

4.    Incorporate selected mechanisms into the project plan.
SP 2.6         Plan Stakeholder Involvement

Plan the involvement of identified stakeholders.

 
IPPD Addition

When integrated teams are formed, stakeholder involvement should be planned down to the integrated team level.

 

Stakeholders are identified from all phases of the project lifecycle by identifying the type of people and functions needing representation in the project and describing their relevance and the degree of interaction for specific project activities. A two-dimensional matrix with stakeholders along one axis and project activities along the other axis is a convenient format for accomplishing this identification. Relevance of the stakeholder to the activity in a particular project phase and the amount of interaction expected would be shown at the intersection of the project phase activity axis and the stakeholder axis.

For the inputs of stakeholders to be useful, careful selection of relevant stakeholders is necessary. For each major activity, identify the stakeholders who are affected by the activity and those who have expertise that is needed to conduct the activity. This list of relevant stakeholders will probably change as the project moves through the phases of the project lifecycle. It is important, however, to ensure that relevant stakeholders in the latter phases of the lifecycle have early input to requirements and design decisions that affect them.
Examples of the type of material that should be included in a plan for stakeholder interaction include the following:

·         List of all relevant stakeholders

·         Rationale for stakeholder involvement

·         Roles and responsibilities of the relevant stakeholders with respect to the project, by project lifecycle phase

·         Relationships between stakeholders

·         Relative importance of the stakeholder to success of the project, by project lifecycle phase

·         Resources (e.g., training, materials, time, and funding) needed to ensure stakeholder interaction

·         Schedule for phasing of stakeholder interaction

 

Conduct of this specific practice relies on shared or exchanged information with the previous Plan for Needed Knowledge and Skills specific practice.

Typical Work Products

1.    Stakeholder involvement plan
SP 2.7         Establish the Project Plan

Establish and maintain the overall project plan content.

A documented plan that addresses all relevant planning items is necessary to achieve the mutual understanding, commitment, and performance of individuals, groups, and organizations that must execute or support the plans. The plan generated for the project defines all aspects of the effort, tying together in a logical manner: project lifecycle considerations; technical and management tasks; budgets and schedules; milestones; data management, risk identification, resource and skill requirements; and stakeholder identification and interaction. Infrastructure descriptions include responsibility and authority relationships for project staff, management, and support organizations.

 

For Software Engineering

For software, the planning document is often referred to as one of the following:

·  Software development plan

·  Software project plan

·  Software plan

 

 

For Hardware Engineering

For hardware, the planning document is often referred to as a hardware development plan. Development activities in preparation for production may be included in the hardware development plan or defined in a separate production plan.

 
Examples of plans that have been used in the U.S. Department of Defense community include the following:

·         Integrated Master Plan—an event-driven plan that documents significant accomplishments with pass/fail criteria for both business and technical elements of the project and that ties each accomplishment to a key program event.

·         Integrated Master Schedule—an integrated and networked multi-layered schedule of program tasks required to complete the work effort documented in a related Integrated Master Plan.

·         Systems Engineering Management Plan—a plan that details the integrated technical effort across the project.

·         Systems Engineering Master Schedule—an event-based schedule that contains a compilation of key technical accomplishments, each with measurable criteria, requiring successful completion to pass identified events.

·         Systems Engineering Detailed Schedule—a detailed, time-dependent, task-oriented schedule that associates specific dates and milestones with the Systems Engineering Master Schedule.

 

Typical Work Products

1.    Overall project plan
SG 3            Obtain Commitment to the Plan

Commitments to the project plan are established and maintained.

To be effective, plans require commitment by those responsible for implementing and supporting the plan.
SP 3.1         Review Plans That Affect the Project

Review all plans that affect the project to understand project commitments.

 
IPPD Addition

When integrated teams are formed, their integrated work plans are among the plans to review.

 

Plans developed within other process areas will typically contain information similar to that called for in the overall project plan. These plans may provide additional detailed guidance and should be compatible with and support the overall project plan to indicate who has the authority, responsibility, accountability, and control. All plans that affect the project should be reviewed to ensure a common understanding of the scope, objectives, roles, and relationships that are required for the project to be successful. Many of these plans are described by the Plan the Process generic practice in each of the process areas.

Typical Work Products

1.    Record of the reviews of plans that affect the project
SP 3.2         Reconcile Work and Resource Levels

Reconcile the project plan to reflect available and estimated resources.

 
IPPD Addition

When integrated teams are formed, special attention should be paid to resource commitments in circumstances of distributed integrated teams and when people are on multiple integrated teams in one or more projects.

 

To establish a project that is feasible, obtain commitment from relevant stakeholders and reconcile any differences between the estimates and the available resources. Reconciliation is typically accomplished by lowering or deferring technical performance requirements, negotiating more resources, finding ways to increase productivity, outsourcing, adjusting the staff skill mix, or revising all plans that affect the project or schedules.

Typical Work Products

1.    Revised methods and corresponding estimating parameters (e.g., better tools and use of off-the-shelf components)

2.    Renegotiated budgets

3.    Revised schedules

4.    Revised requirements list

5.    Renegotiated stakeholder agreements
SP 3.3         Obtain Plan Commitment

Obtain commitment from relevant stakeholders responsible for performing and supporting plan execution.

 
IPPD Addition

When integrated teams are formed, the integrated team plans should have buy-in from the team members, the interfacing teams, the project, and the process owners of the standard processes that the team has selected for tailored application.

 

Obtaining commitment involves interaction among all relevant stakeholders both internal and external to the project. The individual or group making a commitment should have confidence that the work can be performed within cost, schedule, and performance constraints. Often, a provisional commitment is adequate to allow the effort to begin and to permit research to be performed to increase confidence to the appropriate level needed to obtain a full commitment.

Typical Work Products

1.    Documented requests for commitments

2.    Documented commitments

Subpractices

1.    Identify needed support and negotiate commitments with relevant stakeholders.

The WBS can be used as a checklist for ensuring that commitments are obtained for all tasks.

The plan for stakeholder interaction should identify all parties from whom commitment should be obtained.

2.    Document all organizational commitments, both full and provisional, ensuring appropriate level of signatories.

Commitments must be documented to ensure a consistent mutual understanding as well as for tracking and maintenance. Provisional commitments should be accompanied by a description of the risks associated with the relationship.

3.    Review internal commitments with senior management as appropriate.

4.    Review external commitments with senior management as appropriate.

Management may have the necessary insight and authority to reduce risks associated with external commitments.

5.    Identify commitments on interfaces between elements in the project, and with other projects and organizational units so that they can be monitored.

Well-defined interface specifications form the basis for commitments.

[Process and Product Quality Assurance]()

A Support Process Area at Maturity Level 2

Purpose

The purpose of Process and Product Quality Assurance (PPQA) is to provide staff and management with objective insight into processes and associated work products.

Introductory Notes

The Process and Product Quality Assurance process area involves the following:

·         Objectively evaluating performed processes, work products, and services against the applicable process descriptions, standards, and procedures

·         Identifying and documenting noncompliance issues

·         Providing feedback to project staff and managers on the results of quality assurance activities

·         Ensuring that noncompliance issues are addressed

The Process and Product Quality Assurance process area supports the delivery of high-quality products and services by providing the project staff and managers at all levels with appropriate visibility into, and feedback on, processes and associated work products throughout the life of the project.

The practices in the Process and Product Quality Assurance process area ensure that planned processes are implemented, while the practices in the Verification process area ensure that the specified requirements are satisfied. These two process areas may on occasion address the same work product but from different perspectives. Projects should take advantage of the overlap in order to minimize duplication of effort while taking care to maintain the separate perspectives.

Objectivity in process and product quality assurance evaluations is critical to the success of the project. (See the definition of “objectively evaluate” in the glossary.) Objectivity is achieved by both independence and the use of criteria. A combination of methods providing evaluations against criteria by those not producing the work product is often used. Less formal methods can be used to provide broad day-to-day coverage. More formal methods can be used periodically to assure objectivity.
Examples of ways to perform objective evaluations include the following:

·         Formal audits by organizationally separate quality assurance organizations

·         Peer reviews which may be performed at various levels of formality

·         In-depth review of work at the place it is performed (i.e., desk audits)

·         Distributed review and comment of work products

 

Traditionally, a quality assurance group that is independent of the project provides this objectivity. It may be appropriate in some organizations, however, to implement the process and product quality assurance role without that kind of independence. For example, in an organization with an open, quality-oriented culture, the process and product quality assurance role may be performed, partially or completely, by peers; and the quality assurance function may be embedded in the process. For small organizations, this might be the most feasible approach.

If quality assurance is embedded in the process, several issues must be addressed to ensure objectivity. Everyone performing quality assurance activities should be trained in quality assurance. Those performing quality assurance activities for a work product should be separate from those directly involved in developing or maintaining the work product. An independent reporting channel to the appropriate level of organizational management must be available so that noncompliance issues can be escalated as necessary.
For example, in implementing peer reviews as an objective evaluation method:

·         Members are trained and roles are assigned for people attending the peer reviews.

·         A member of the peer review who did not produce this work product is assigned to perform the role of QA.

·         Checklists are available to support the QA activity.

·         Defects are recorded as part of the peer review report and are tracked and escalated outside the project when necessary.

 

Quality assurance should begin in the early phases of a project to establish plans, processes, standards, and procedures that will add value to the project and satisfy the requirements of the project and the organizational policies. Those performing quality assurance participate in establishing the plans, processes, standards, and procedures to ensure that they fit the project’s needs and that they will be useable for performing quality assurance evaluations. In addition, the specific processes and associated work products that will be evaluated during the project are designated. This designation may be based on sampling or on objective criteria that are consistent with organizational policies and project requirements and needs.

When noncompliance issues are identified, they are first addressed within the project and resolved there if possible. Any noncompliance issues that cannot be resolved within the project are escalated to an appropriate level of management for resolution.

This process area applies primarily to evaluations of the activities and work products of a project, but it also applies to evaluations of nonproject activities and work products such as training activities. For these activities and work products, the term “project” should be appropriately interpreted.

[Quantitative Project Management]()

A Project Management Process Area at Maturity Level 4

Purpose

The purpose of Quantitative Project Management (QPM) is to quantitatively manage the project’s defined process to achieve the project’s established quality and process-performance objectives.

Introductory Notes

The Quantitative Project Management process area involves the following:

·         Establishing and maintaining the project’s quality and process-performance objectives

·         Identifying suitable subprocesses that compose the project’s defined process based on historical stability and capability data found in process-performance baselines or models

·         Selecting the subprocesses of the project’s defined process to be statistically managed

·         Monitoring the project to determine whether the project’s objectives for quality and process performance are being satisfied, and identifying appropriate corrective action

·         Selecting the measures and analytic techniques to be used in statistically managing the selected subprocesses

·         Establishing and maintaining an understanding of the variation of the selected subprocesses using the selected measures and analytic techniques

·         Monitoring the performance of the selected subprocesses to determine whether they are capable of satisfying their quality and process-performance objectives, and identifying corrective action

·         Recording statistical and quality management data in the organization’s measurement repository

The quality and process-performance objectives, measures, and baselines identified here are developed as described in the Organizational Process Performance process area. Subsequently, the results of performing the processes associated with the Quantitative Project Management process area (e.g., measurement definitions and measurement data) become part of the organizational process assets referred to in the Organizational Process Performance process area.

To effectively address the specific practices in this process area, the organization should have already established a set of standard processes and related organizational process assets, such as the organization’s measurement repository and the organization’s process asset library for use by each project in establishing its defined process. The project’s defined process is a set of subprocesses that form an integrated and coherent lifecycle for the project. It is established, in part, through selecting and tailoring processes from the organization’s set of standard processes. (See the definition of “defined process” in the glossary.)

The project should also ensure that the measurements and progress of the supplier’s efforts are made available. Establishment of effective relationships with suppliers is necessary for the successful implementation of this process area’s specific practices.

Process performance is a measure of the actual process results achieved. Process performance is characterized by both process measures (e.g., effort, cycle time, and defect removal efficiency) and product measures (e.g., reliability, defect density, and response time).

Subprocesses are defined components of a larger defined process. For example, a typical organization’s development process may be defined in terms of subprocesses such as requirements development, design, build, test, and peer review. The subprocesses themselves may be further decomposed as necessary into other subprocesses and process elements.

One essential element of quantitative management is having confidence in estimates (i.e., being able to predict the extent to which the project can fulfill its quality and process-performance objectives). The subprocesses that will be statistically managed are chosen based on identified needs for predictable performance. (See the definitions of “statistically managed process,” “quality and process-performance objective,” and “quantitatively managed process” in the glossary.)

Another essential element of quantitative management is understanding the nature and extent of the variation experienced in process performance, and recognizing when the project’s actual performance may not be adequate to achieve the project’s quality and process-performance objectives.

Statistical management involves statistical thinking and the correct use of a variety of statistical techniques, such as run charts, control charts, confidence intervals, prediction intervals, and tests of hypotheses. Quantitative management uses data from statistical management to help the project predict whether it will be able to achieve its quality and process-performance objectives and identify what corrective action should be taken.

This process area applies to managing a project, but the concepts found here also apply to managing other groups and functions. Applying these concepts to managing other groups and functions may not necessarily contribute to achieving the organization’s business objectives, but may help these groups and functions control their own processes.
Examples of other groups and functions include the following:

·         Quality assurance

·         Process definition and improvement

·         Effort reporting

·         Customer complaint handling

Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Quantitatively Manage the Project

The project is quantitatively managed using quality and process-performance objectives.
SP 1.1         Establish the Project’s Objectives

Establish and maintain the project’s quality and process-performance objectives.

When establishing the project’s quality and process-performance objectives, it is often useful to think ahead about which processes from the organization’s set of standard processes will be included in the project’s defined process, and what the historical data indicates regarding their process performance. These considerations will help in establishing realistic objectives for the project. Later, as the project’s actual performance becomes known and more predictable, the objectives may need to be revised.

Typical Work Products

1.    The project’s quality and process-performance objectives

Subpractices

1.    Review the organization's objectives for quality and process performance.

The intent of this review is to ensure that the project understands the broader business context in which the project will need to operate. The project’s objectives for quality and process performance are developed in the context of these overarching organizational objectives.

Refer to the Organizational Process Performance process area for more information about the organization’s quality and process-performance objectives.

2.    Identify the quality and process performance needs and priorities of the customer, suppliers, end users, and other relevant stakeholders.
Examples of quality and process-performance attributes for which needs and priorities might be identified include the following:

·       Functionality

·       Reliability

·       Maintainability

·       Usability

·       Duration

·       Predictability

·       Timeliness

·       Accuracy

 

3.    Identify how process performance is to be measured.

Consider whether the measures established by the organization are adequate for assessing progress in fulfilling customer, end-user, and other stakeholder needs and priorities. It may be necessary to supplement these with additional measures.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for more information about defining measures.

4.    Define and document measurable quality and process-performance objectives for the project.

Defining and documenting objectives for the project involve the following:

·       Incorporating the organization’s quality and process-performance objectives

·       Writing objectives that reflect the quality and process-performance needs and priorities of the customer, end users, and other stakeholders, and the way these objectives should be measured
Examples of quality attributes for which objectives might be written include the following:

·       Mean time between failures

·       Critical resource utilization

·       Number and severity of defects in the released product

·       Number and severity of customer complaints concerning the provided service

 

Examples of process-performance attributes for which objectives might be written include the following:

·       Percentage of defects removed by product verification activities (perhaps by type of verification, such as peer reviews and testing)

·       Defect escape rates

·       Number and density of defects (by severity) found during the first year following product delivery (or start of service)

·       Cycle time

·       Percentage of rework time

 

5.    Derive interim objectives for each lifecycle phase, as appropriate, to monitor progress toward achieving the project’s objectives.
An example of a method to predict future results of a process is the use of process-performance models to predict the latent defects in the delivered product using interim measures of defects identified during product verification activities (e.g., peer reviews and testing).

 

6.    Resolve conflicts among the project’s quality and process-performance objectives (e.g., if one objective cannot be achieved without compromising another objective).

Resolving conflicts involves the following:

·       Setting relative priorities for the objectives

·       Considering alternative objectives in light of long-term business strategies as well as short-term needs

·       Involving the customer, end users, senior management, project management, and other relevant stakeholders in the tradeoff decisions

·       Revising the objectives as necessary to reflect the results of the conflict resolution

7.    Establish traceability to the project’s quality and process-performance objectives from their sources.
Examples of sources for objectives include the following:

·       Requirements

·       Organization’s quality and process-performance objectives

·       Customer’s quality and process-performance objectives

·       Business objectives

·       Discussions with customers and potential customers

·       Market surveys

 

An example of a method to identify and trace these needs and priorities is Quality Function Deployment (QFD).

 

8.    Define and negotiate quality and process-performance objectives for suppliers.

Refer to the Supplier Agreement Management process area for more information about establishing and maintaining agreements with suppliers.

9.    Revise the project’s quality and process-performance objectives as necessary.
SP 1.2         Compose the Defined Process

Select the subprocesses that compose the project’s defined process based on historical stability and capability data.

Refer to the Integrated Project Management process area for more information about establishing and maintaining the project’s defined process.

Refer to the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about the organization’s process asset library, which might include a process element of known and needed capability.

Refer to the Organizational Process Performance process area for more information about the organization’s process-performance baselines and process-performance models.

Subprocesses are identified from the process elements in the organization’s set of standard processes and the process artifacts in the organization’s process asset library.

Typical Work Products

1.    Criteria used in identifying which subprocesses are valid candidates for inclusion in the project’s defined process

2.    Candidate subprocesses for inclusion in the project’s defined process

3.    Subprocesses to be included in the project’s defined process

4.    Identified risks when selected subprocesses lack a process-performance history

Subpractices

1.    Establish the criteria to use in identifying which subprocesses are valid candidates for use.

 

Identification may be based on the following:

·       Quality and process-performance objectives

·       Existence of process-performance data

·       Product line standards

·       Project lifecycle models

·       Customer requirements

·       Laws and regulations

2.    Determine whether the subprocesses that are to be statistically managed, and that were obtained from the organizational process assets, are suitable for statistical management.

A subprocess may be more suitable for statistical management if it has a history of the following:

·       Stable performance in previous comparable instances

·       Process-performance data that satisfies the project’s quality and process-performance objectives

Historical data are primarily obtained from the organization’s process-performance baselines. However, these data may not be available for all subprocesses.

3.    Analyze the interaction of subprocesses to understand the relationships among the subprocesses and the measured attributes of the subprocesses.
Examples of analysis techniques include system dynamics models and simulations.

 

4.    Identify the risk when no subprocess is available that is known to be capable of satisfying the quality and process-performance objectives (i.e., no capable subprocess is available or the capability of the subprocess is not known).

Even when a subprocess has not been selected to be statistically managed, historical data and process-performance models may indicate that the subprocess is not capable of satisfying the quality and process-performance objectives.

Refer to the Risk Management process area for more information about risk identification and analysis.
SP 1.3         Select the Subprocesses that Will Be Statistically Managed

Select the subprocesses of the project's defined process that will be statistically managed.

Selecting the subprocesses to be statistically managed is often a concurrent and iterative process of identifying applicable project and organization quality and process-performance objectives, selecting the subprocesses, and identifying the process and product attributes to measure and control. Often the selection of a process, quality and process-performance objective, or measurable attribute will constrain the selection of the other two. For example, if a particular process is selected, the measurable attributes and quality and process-performance objectives may be constrained by that process.

Typical Work Products

1.    Quality and process-performance objectives that will be addressed by statistical management

2.    Criteria used in selecting which subprocesses will be statistically managed

3.    Subprocesses that will be statistically managed

4.    Identified process and product attributes of the selected subprocesses that should be measured and controlled

Subpractices

1.    Identify which of the quality and process-performance objectives of the project will be statistically managed.

2.    Identify the criteria to be used in selecting the subprocesses that are the main contributors to achieving the identified quality and process-performance objectives and for which predictable performance is important.
Examples of sources for criteria used in selecting subprocesses include the following:

·       Customer requirements related to quality and process performance

·       Quality and process-performance objectives established by the customer

·       Quality and process-performance objectives established by the organization

·       Organization’s performance baselines and models

·       Stable performance of the subprocess on other projects

·       Laws and regulations

 

3.    Select the subprocesses that will be statistically managed using the selection criteria.

It may not be possible to statistically manage some subprocesses (e.g., where new subprocesses and technologies are being piloted). In other cases, it may not be economically justifiable to apply statistical techniques to certain subprocesses.

4.    Identify the product and process attributes of the selected subprocesses that will be measured and controlled.
Examples of product and process attributes include the following:

·       Defect density

·       Cycle time

·       Test coverage

 

SP 1.4         Manage Project Performance

Monitor the project to determine whether the project’s objectives for quality and process performance will be satisfied, and identify corrective action as appropriate.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for more information about analyzing and using measures.

A prerequisite for such a comparison is that the selected subprocesses of the project’s defined process are being statistically managed and their process capability is understood. The specific practices of specific goal 2 provide detail on statistically managing the selected subprocesses.

Typical Work Products

1.    Estimates (predictions) of the achievement of the project’s quality and process-performance objectives

2.    Documentation of the risks in achieving the project’s quality and process-performance objectives

3.    Documentation of actions needed to address the deficiencies in achieving the project’s objectives

Subpractices

1.    Periodically review the performance of each subprocess and the capability of each subprocess selected to be statistically managed to appraise progress toward achieving the project’s quality and process-performance objectives.

The process capability of each selected subprocess is determined with respect to that subprocess’ established quality and process-performance objectives. These objectives are derived from the project’s quality and process-performance objectives, which are for the project as a whole.

2.    Periodically review the actual results achieved against established interim objectives for each phase of the project lifecycle to appraise progress toward achieving the project’s quality and process-performance objectives.

3.    Track suppliers’ results for achieving their quality and process-performance objectives.

4.    Use process-performance models calibrated with obtained measures of critical attributes to estimate progress toward achieving the project’s quality and process-performance objectives.

Process-performance models are used to estimate progress toward achieving objectives that cannot be measured until a future phase in the project lifecycle. An example is the use of process-performance models to predict the latent defects in the delivered product using interim measures of defects identified during peer reviews.

Refer to the Organizational Process Performance process area for more information about process-performance models.

The calibration is based on the results obtained from performing the previous subpractices.

5.    Identify and manage the risks associated with achieving the project’s quality and process-performance objectives.

Refer to the Risk Management process area for more information about identifying and managing risks.
Example sources of the risks include the following:

·       Inadequate stability and capability data in the organization’s measurement repository

·       Subprocesses having inadequate performance or capability

·       Suppliers not achieving their quality and process-performance objectives

·       Lack of visibility into supplier capability

·       Inaccuracies in the organization’s process-performance models for predicting future performance

·       Deficiencies in predicted process performance (estimated progress)

·       Other identified risks associated with identified deficiencies

 

6.    Determine and document actions needed to address the deficiencies in achieving the project’s quality and process-performance objectives.

The intent of these actions is to plan and deploy the right set of activities, resources, and schedule to place the project back on track as much as possible to meet its objectives.
Examples of actions that can be taken to address deficiencies in achieving the project’s objectives include the following:

·       Changing quality or process-performance objectives so that they are within the expected range of the project’s defined process

·       Improving the implementation of the project’s defined process so as to reduce its normal variability (reducing variability may bring the project’s performance within the objectives without having to move the mean)

·       Adopting new subprocesses and technologies that have the potential for satisfying the objectives and managing the associated risks

·       Identifying the risk and risk mitigation strategies for the deficiencies

·       Terminating the project

 

Refer to the Project Monitoring and Control process area for more information about taking corrective action.
SG 2            Statistically Manage Subprocess Performance

The performance of selected subprocesses within the project's defined process is statistically managed.

This specific goal describes an activity critical to achieving the Quantitatively Manage the Project specific goal of this process area. The specific practices under this specific goal describe how to statistically manage the subprocesses whose selection was described in the specific practices under the first specific goal. When the selected subprocesses are statistically managed, their capability to achieve their objectives can be determined. By these means, it will be possible to predict whether the project will be able to achieve its objectives, which is key to quantitatively managing the project.
SP 2.1         Select Measures and Analytic Techniques

Select the measures and analytic techniques to be used in statistically managing the selected subprocesses.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for more information about establishing measurable objectives; on defining, collecting, and analyzing measures; and on revising measures and statistical analysis techniques.

Typical Work Products

1.    Definitions of the measures and analytic techniques to be used in (or proposed for) statistically managing the subprocesses

2.    Operational definitions of the measures, their collection points in the subprocesses, and how the integrity of the measures will be determined

3.    Traceability of measures back to the project’s quality and process-performance objectives

4.    Instrumented organizational support environment to support automatic data collection

Subpractices

1.    Identify common measures from the organizational process assets that support statistical management.

Refer to the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about common measures.

Product lines or other stratification criteria may categorize common measures.

2.    Identify additional measures that may be needed for this instance to cover critical product and process attributes of the selected subprocesses.

In some cases, measures may be research oriented. Such measures should be explicitly identified.

3.    Identify the measures that are appropriate for statistical management.

Critical criteria for selecting statistical management measures include the following:

·       Controllable (e.g., can a measure’s values be changed by changing how the subprocess is implemented?)

·       Adequate performance indicator (e.g., is the measure a good indicator of how well the subprocess is performing relative to the objectives of interest?)
Examples of subprocess measures include the following:

·       Requirements volatility

·       Ratios of estimated to measured values of the planning parameters (e.g., size, cost, and schedule)

·       Coverage and efficiency of peer reviews

·       Test coverage and efficiency

·       Effectiveness of training (e.g., percent of planned training completed and test scores)

·       Reliability

·       Percentage of the total defects inserted or found in the different phases of the project lifecycle

·       Percentage of the total effort expended in the different phases of the project lifecycle

 

4.    Specify the operational definitions of the measures, their collection points in the subprocesses, and how the integrity of the measures will be determined.

Operational definitions are stated in precise and unambiguous terms. They address two important criteria as follows:

·       Communication: What has been measured, how it was measured, what the units of measure are, and what has been included or excluded

·       Repeatability: Whether the measurement can be repeated, given the same definition, to get the same results

5.    Analyze the relationship of the identified measures to the organization’s and project’s objectives, and derive objectives that state specific target measures or ranges to be met for each measured attribute of each selected subprocess.

6.    Instrument the organizational support environment to support collection, derivation, and analysis of statistical measures.

The instrumentation is based on the following:

·       Description of the organization’s set of standard processes

·       Description of the project’s defined process

·       Capabilities of the organizational support environment

7.    Identify the appropriate statistical analysis techniques that are expected to be useful in statistically managing the selected subprocesses.

The concept of “one size does not fit all” applies to statistical analysis techniques. What makes a particular technique appropriate is not just the type of measures, but more important, how the measures will be used and whether the situation warrants applying that technique. The appropriateness of the selection may need to be investigated from time to time.

Examples of statistical analysis techniques are given in the next specific practice.

8.    Revise the measures and statistical analysis techniques as necessary.
SP 2.2         Apply Statistical Methods to Understand Variation

Establish and maintain an understanding of the variation of the selected subprocesses using the selected measures and analytic techniques.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for more information about collecting, analyzing, and using measurement results.

Understanding variation is achieved, in part, by collecting and analyzing process and product measures so that special causes of variation can be identified and addressed to achieve predictable performance.

A special cause of process variation is characterized by an unexpected change in process performance. Special causes are also known as “assignable causes” because they can be identified, analyzed, and addressed to prevent recurrence.

The identification of special causes of variation is based on departures from the system of common causes of variation. These departures can be identified by the presence of extreme values, or other identifiable patterns in the data collected from the subprocess or associated work products. Knowledge of variation and insight about potential sources of anomalous patterns are typically needed to detect special causes of variation.
Sources of anomalous patterns of variation may include the following:

·         Lack of process compliance

·         Undistinguished influences of multiple underlying subprocesses on the data

·         Ordering or timing of activities within the subprocess

·         Uncontrolled inputs to the subprocess

·         Environmental changes during subprocess execution

·         Schedule pressure

·         Inappropriate sampling or grouping of data

 

Typical Work Products

1.    Collected measures

2.    Natural bounds of process performance for each measured attribute of each selected subprocess

3.    Process performance compared to the natural bounds of process performance for each measured attribute of each selected subprocess

Subpractices

1.   Establish trial natural bounds for subprocesses having suitable historical performance data.

Refer to the Organizational Process Performance process area for more information about organizational process-performance baselines.

Natural bounds of an attribute are the range within which variation normally occurs. All processes will show some variation in process and product measures each time they are executed. The issue is whether this variation is due to common causes of variation in the normal performance of the process or to some special cause that can and should be identified and removed.

When a subprocess is initially executed, suitable data for establishing trial natural bounds are sometimes available from prior instances of the subprocess or comparable subprocesses, process-performance baselines, or process-performance models. These data are typically contained in the organization’s measurement repository. As the subprocess is executed, data specific to that instance are collected and used to update and replace the trial natural bounds. However, if the subprocess in question has been materially tailored, or if the conditions are materially different from those in previous instantiations, the data in the repository may not be relevant and should not be used.

In some cases, there may be no historical comparable data (e.g., when introducing a new subprocess, when entering a new application domain, or when significant changes have been made to the subprocess). In such cases, trial natural bounds will have to be made from early process data of this subprocess. These trial natural bounds must then be refined and updated as subprocess execution continues.
Examples of criteria for determining whether data are comparable include the following:

·       Product lines

·       Application domain

·       Work product and task attributes (e.g., size of product)

·       Size of project

 

2.    Collect data, as defined by the selected measures, on the subprocesses as they execute.

3.    Calculate the natural bounds of process performance for each measured attribute.
Examples of where the natural bounds are calculated include the following:

·       Control charts

·       Confidence intervals (for parameters of distributions)

·       Prediction intervals (for future outcomes)

 

4.    Identify special causes of variation.
An example of a criterion for detecting a special cause of process variation in a control chart is a data point that falls outside of the 3-sigma control limits.

 

The criteria for detecting special causes of variation are based on statistical theory and experience and depend on economic justification. As criteria are added, special causes are more likely to be identified if present, but the likelihood of false alarms also increases.

5.    Analyze the special cause of process variation to determine the reasons the anomaly occurred.
Examples of techniques for analyzing the reasons for special causes of variation include the following:

·       Cause-and-effect (fishbone) diagrams

·       Designed experiments

·       Control charts (applied to subprocess inputs or to lower level subprocesses)

·       Subgrouping (analyzing the same data segregated into smaller groups based on an understanding of how the subprocess was implemented facilitates isolation of special causes)

 

Some anomalies may simply be extremes of the underlying distribution rather than problems. The people implementing a subprocess are usually the ones best able to analyze and understand special causes of variation.

6.    Determine what corrective action should be taken when special causes of variation are identified.

Removing a special cause of process variation does not change the underlying subprocess. It addresses an error in the way the subprocess is being executed.

Refer to the Project Monitoring and Control process area for more information about taking corrective action.

7.    Recalculate the natural bounds for each measured attribute of the selected subprocesses as necessary.

Recalculating the (statistically estimated) natural bounds is based on measured values that signify that the subprocess has changed, not on expectations or arbitrary decisions.
Examples of when the natural bounds may need to be recalculated include the following:

·       There are incremental improvements to the subprocess

·       New tools are deployed for the subprocess

·       A new subprocess is deployed

·       The collected measures suggest that the subprocess mean has permanently shifted or the subprocess variation has permanently changed

 

SP 2.3         Monitor Performance of the Selected Subprocesses

Monitor the performance of the selected subprocesses to determine their capability to satisfy their quality and process-performance objectives, and identify corrective action as necessary.

The intent of this specific practice is to do the following:

·         Determine statistically the process behavior expected from the subprocess

·         Appraise the probability that the process will meet its quality and process-performance objectives

·         Identify the corrective action to be taken, based on a statistical analysis of the process-performance data

Corrective action may include renegotiating the affected project objectives, identifying and implementing alternative subprocesses, or identifying and measuring lower level subprocesses to achieve greater detail in the performance data. Any or all of these actions are intended to help the project use a more capable process. (See the definition of “capable process” in the glossary.)

A prerequisite for comparing the capability of a selected subprocess against its quality and process-performance objectives is that the performance of the subprocess is stable and predictable with respect to its measured attributes.

Process capability is analyzed for those subprocesses and those measured attributes for which (derived) objectives have been established. Not all subprocesses or measured attributes that are statistically managed are analyzed regarding process capability.

The historical data may be inadequate for initially determining whether the subprocess is capable. It also is possible that the estimated natural bounds for subprocess performance may shift away from the quality and process-performance objectives. In either case, statistical control implies monitoring capability as well as stability.

Typical Work Products

1.    Natural bounds of process performance for each selected subprocess compared to its established (derived) objectives

2.    For each subprocess, its process capability

3.    For each subprocess, the actions needed to address deficiencies in its process capability

Subpractices

1.    Compare the quality and process-performance objectives to the natural bounds of the measured attribute.

This comparison provides an appraisal of the process capability for each measured attribute of a subprocess. These comparisons can be displayed graphically, in ways that relate the estimated natural bounds to the objectives or as process capability indices, which summarize the relationship of the objectives to the natural bounds.

2.    Monitor changes in quality and process-performance objectives and selected subprocess’ process capability.

3.    Identify and document subprocess capability deficiencies.

4.    Determine and document actions needed to address subprocess capability deficiencies.
Examples of actions that can be taken when a selected subprocess’s performance does not satisfy its objectives include the following:

·       Changing quality and process-performance objectives so that they are within the subprocess’ process capability

·       Improving the implementation of the existing subprocess so as to reduce its normal variability (reducing variability may bring the natural bounds within the objectives without having to move the mean)

·       Adopting new process elements and subprocesses and technologies that have the potential for satisfying the objectives and managing the associated risks

·       Identifying risks and risk mitigation strategies for each subprocess’s process capability deficiency

This process area describes three types of requirements: customer requirements, product requirements, and product component requirements. Taken together, these requirements address the needs of relevant stakeholders, including those pertinent to various product lifecycle phases (e.g., acceptance testing criteria) and product attributes (e.g., safety, reliability, and maintainability). Requirements also address constraints caused by the selection of design solutions (e.g., integration of commercial off-the-shelf products).

All development projects have requirements. In the case of a project that is focused on maintenance activities, the changes to the product or product components are based on changes to the existing requirements, design, or implementation. The requirements changes, if any, might be documented in change requests from the customer or users, or they might take the form of new requirements received from the requirements development process. Regardless of their source or form, the maintenance activities that are driven by changes to requirements are managed accordingly.

Requirements are the basis for design. The development of requirements includes the following activities:

·         Elicitation, analysis, validation, and communication of customer needs, expectations, and constraints to obtain customer requirements that constitute an understanding of what will satisfy stakeholders

·         Collection and coordination of stakeholder needs

·         Development of the lifecycle requirements of the product

·         Establishment of the customer requirements

·         Establishment of initial product and product component requirements consistent with customer requirements

This process area addresses all customer requirements rather than only product-level requirements because the customer may also provide specific design requirements.

Customer requirements are further refined into product and product component requirements. In addition to customer requirements, product and product component requirements are derived from the selected design solutions. Throughout the process areas, where we use the terms product and product component, their intended meanings also encompass services and their components.

Requirements are identified and refined throughout the phases of the product lifecycle. Design decisions, subsequent corrective actions, and feedback during each phase of the product’s lifecycle are analyzed for impact on derived and allocated requirements.

The Requirements Development process area includes three specific goals. The Develop Customer Requirements specific goal addresses defining a set of customer requirements to use in the development of product requirements. The Develop Product Requirements specific goal addresses defining a set of product or product component requirements to use in the design of products and product components. The Analyze and Validate Requirements specific goal addresses the necessary analysis of customer, product, and product component requirements to define, derive, and understand the requirements. The specific practices of the third specific goal are intended to assist the specific practices in the first two specific goals. The processes associated with the Requirements Development process area and those associated with the Technical Solution process area may interact recursively with one another.

Analyses are used to understand, define, and select the requirements at all levels from competing alternatives. These analyses include the following:

·         Analysis of needs and requirements for each product lifecycle phase, including needs of relevant stakeholders, the operational environment, and factors that reflect overall customer and end-user expectations and satisfaction, such as safety, security, and affordability

·         Development of an operational concept

·         Definition of the required functionality

The definition of functionality, also referred to as “functional analysis,” is not the same as structured analysis in software development and does not presume a functionally oriented software design. In object-oriented software design, it relates to defining what are called “services” or “methods.” The definition of functions, their logical groupings, and their association with requirements is referred to as a “functional architecture.”

Analyses occur recursively at successively more detailed layers of a product’s architecture until sufficient detail is available to enable detailed design, acquisition, and testing of the product to proceed. As a result of the analysis of requirements and the operational concept (including functionality, support, maintenance, and disposal), the manufacturing or production concept produces more derived requirements, including consideration of the following:

·         Constraints of various types

·         Technological limitations

·         Cost and cost drivers

·         Time constraints and schedule drivers

·         Risks

·         Consideration of issues implied but not explicitly stated by the customer or end user

·         Factors introduced by the developer’s unique business considerations, regulations, and laws

A hierarchy of logical entities (functions and subfunctions, object classes and subclasses) is established through iteration with the evolving operational concept. Requirements are refined, derived, and allocated to these logical entities. Requirements and logical entities are allocated to products, product components, people, or associated processes.

Involvement of relevant stakeholders in both requirements development and analysis gives them visibility into the evolution of requirements. This activity continually assures them that the requirements are being properly defined.

Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Develop Customer Requirements

Stakeholder needs, expectations, constraints, and interfaces are collected and translated into customer requirements.

The needs of stakeholders (e.g., customers, end users, suppliers, builders, testers, manufacturers, and logistics support personnel) are the basis for determining customer requirements. The stakeholder needs, expectations, constraints, interfaces, operational concepts, and product concepts are analyzed, harmonized, refined, and elaborated for translation into a set of customer requirements.

Frequently, stakeholder needs, expectations, constraints, and interfaces are poorly identified or conflicting. Since stakeholder needs, expectations, constraints, and limitations should be clearly identified and understood, an iterative process is used throughout the life of the project to accomplish this objective. To facilitate the required interaction, a surrogate for the end user or customer is frequently involved to represent their needs and help resolve conflicts. The customer relations or marketing part of the organization as well as members of the development team from disciplines such as human engineering or support can be used as surrogates. Environmental, legal, and other constraints should be considered when creating and resolving the set of customer requirements.
SP 1.1         Elicit Needs

Elicit stakeholder needs, expectations, constraints, and interfaces for all phases of the product lifecycle.

Eliciting goes beyond collecting requirements by proactively identifying additional requirements not explicitly provided by customers. Additional requirements should address the various product lifecycle activities and their impact on the product.
Examples of techniques to elicit needs include the following:

·         Technology demonstrations

·         Interface control working groups

·         Technical control working groups

·         Interim project reviews

·         Questionnaires, interviews, and operational scenarios obtained from end users

·         Operational walkthroughs and end-user task analysis

·         Prototypes and models

·         Brainstorming

·         Quality Function Deployment

·         Market surveys

·         Beta testing

·         Extraction from sources such as documents, standards, or specifications

·         Observation of existing products, environments, and workflow patterns

·         Use cases

·         Business case analysis

·         Reverse engineering (for legacy products)

·         Customer satisfaction surveys

 

Examples of sources of requirements that might not be identified by the customer include the following:

·         Business policies

·         Standards

·         Business environmental requirements (e.g., laboratories, testing and other facilities, and information technology infrastructure)

·         Technology

·         Legacy products or product components (reuse product components)

 

Subpractices

1.    Engage relevant stakeholders using methods for eliciting needs, expectations, constraints, and external interfaces.
SP 1.2         Develop the Customer Requirements

Transform stakeholder needs, expectations, constraints, and interfaces into customer requirements.

The various inputs from the relevant stakeholders must be consolidated, missing information must be obtained, and conflicts must be resolved in documenting the recognized set of customer requirements. The customer requirements may include needs, expectations, and constraints with regard to verification and validation.

In some situations, the customer provides a set of requirements to the project, or the requirements exist as an output of a previous project's activities. In these situations, the customer requirements could conflict with the relevant stakeholders' needs, expectations, constraints, and interfaces and will need to be transformed into the recognized set of customer requirements after appropriate resolution of conflicts.

Relevant stakeholders representing all phases of the product's lifecycle should include business as well as technical functions. In this way, concepts for all product-related lifecycle processes are considered concurrently with the concepts for the products. Customer requirements result from informed decisions on the business as well as technical effects of their requirements.

Typical Work Products

1.    Customer requirements

2.    Customer constraints on the conduct of verification

3.    Customer constraints on the conduct of validation

Subpractices

1.    Translate the stakeholder needs, expectations, constraints, and interfaces into documented customer requirements.

2.    Define constraints for verification and validation.
SG 2            Develop Product Requirements

Customer requirements are refined and elaborated to develop product and product component requirements.

Customer requirements are analyzed in conjunction with the development of the operational concept to derive more detailed and precise sets of requirements called “product and product component requirements.” Product and product component requirements address the needs associated with each product lifecycle phase. Derived requirements arise from constraints, consideration of issues implied but not explicitly stated in the customer requirements baseline, and factors introduced by the selected architecture, the design, and the developer’s unique business considerations. The requirements are reexamined with each successive, lower level set of requirements and functional architecture, and the preferred product concept is refined.

The requirements are allocated to product functions and product components including objects, people, and processes. The traceability of requirements to functions, objects, tests, issues, or other entities is documented. The allocated requirements and functions are the basis for the synthesis of the technical solution. As internal components are developed, additional interfaces are defined and interface requirements are established.

Refer to the Maintain Bidirectional Traceability of Requirements specific practice of the Requirements Management process area for more information about maintaining bidirectional traceability.
SP 2.1         Establish Product and Product Component Requirements

Establish and maintain product and product component requirements, which are based on the customer requirements.

The customer requirements may be expressed in the customer’s terms and may be nontechnical descriptions. The product requirements are the expression of these requirements in technical terms that can be used for design decisions. An example of this translation is found in the first House of Quality Function Deployment, which maps customer desires into technical parameters. For instance, “solid sounding door” might be mapped to size, weight, fit, dampening, and resonant frequencies.

Product and product component requirements address the satisfaction of customer, business, and project objectives and associated attributes, such as effectiveness and affordability.

Derived requirements also address the cost and performance of other lifecycle phases (e.g., production, operations, and disposal) to the extent compatible with business objectives.

The modification of requirements due to approved requirement changes is covered by the “maintain” function of this specific practice; whereas, the administration of requirement changes is covered by the Requirements Management process area.

Refer to the Requirements Management process area for more information about managing changes to requirements.

Typical Work Products

1.    Derived requirements

2.    Product requirements

3.    Product component requirements

Subpractices

1.    Develop requirements in technical terms necessary for product and product component design.

Develop architecture requirements addressing critical product qualities and performance necessary for product architecture design.

2.    Derive requirements that result from design decisions.

Refer to the Technical Solution process area for more information about developing the solutions that generate additional derived requirements.

Selection of a technology brings with it additional requirements. For instance, use of electronics requires additional technology-specific requirements such as electromagnetic interference limits.

3.    Establish and maintain relationships between requirements for consideration during change management and requirements allocation.

Refer to the Requirements Management process area for more information about maintaining requirements traceability.

Relationships between requirements can aid in evaluating the impact of changes.
SP 2.2         Allocate Product Component Requirements

Allocate the requirements for each product component.

Refer to the Technical Solution process area for more information about allocation of requirements to products and product components. This specific practice provides information for defining the allocation of requirements but must interact with the specific practices in the Technical Solution process area to establish solutions to which the requirements are allocated.

The requirements for product components of the defined solution include allocation of product performance; design constraints; and fit, form, and function to meet requirements and facilitate production. In cases where a higher level requirement specifies performance that will be the responsibility of two or more product components, the performance must be partitioned for unique allocation to each product component as a derived requirement.

Typical Work Products

1.    Requirement allocation sheets

2.    Provisional requirement allocations

3.    Design constraints

4.    Derived requirements

5.    Relationships among derived requirements

Subpractices

1.    Allocate requirements to functions.

2.    Allocate requirements to product components.

3.    Allocate design constraints to product components.

4.    Document relationships among allocated requirements.

Relationships include dependencies in which a change in one requirement may affect other requirements.
SP 2.3         Identify Interface Requirements

Identify interface requirements.

Interfaces between functions (or between objects) are identified. Functional interfaces may drive the development of alternative solutions described in the Technical Solution process area.

Refer to the Product Integration process area for more information about the management of interfaces and the integration of products and product components.

Interface requirements between products or product components identified in the product architecture are defined. They are controlled as part of product and product component integration and are an integral part of the architecture definition.

Typical Work Products

1.    Interface requirements

Subpractices

1.    Identify interfaces both external to the product and internal to the product (i.e., between functional partitions or objects).

As the design progresses, the product architecture will be altered by technical solution processes, creating new interfaces between product components and components external to the product.

Interfaces with product-related lifecycle processes should also be identified.
Examples of these interfaces include interfaces with test equipment, transportation systems, support systems, and manufacturing facilities.

 

2.    Develop the requirements for the identified interfaces.

Refer to the Technical Solution process area for more information about generating new interfaces during the design process.

Requirements for interfaces are defined in terms such as origination, destination, stimulus, data characteristics for software, and electrical and mechanical characteristics for hardware.
SG 3            Analyze and Validate Requirements

The requirements are analyzed and validated, and a definition of required functionality is developed.

The specific practices of the Analyze and Validate Requirements specific goal support the development of the requirements in both the Develop Customer Requirements specific goal and the Develop Product Requirements specific goal. The specific practices associated with this specific goal cover analyzing and validating the requirements with respect to the user’s intended environment.

Analyses are performed to determine what impact the intended operational environment will have on the ability to satisfy the stakeholders’ needs, expectations, constraints, and interfaces. Considerations, such as feasibility, mission needs, cost constraints, potential market size, and acquisition strategy, must all be taken into account, depending on the product context. A definition of required functionality is also established. All specified usage modes for the product are considered, and a timeline analysis is generated for time-critical sequencing of functions.

The objectives of the analyses are to determine candidate requirements for product concepts that will satisfy stakeholder needs, expectations, and constraints; and then to translate these concepts into requirements. In parallel with this activity, the parameters that will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the product are determined based on customer input and the preliminary product concept.

Requirements are validated to increase the probability that the resulting product will perform as intended in the use environment.
SP 3.1         Establish Operational Concepts and Scenarios

Establish and maintain operational concepts and associated scenarios.

A scenario is typically a sequence of events that might occur in the use of the product, which is used to make explicit some of the needs of the stakeholders. In contrast, an operational concept for a product usually depends on both the design solution and the scenario. For example, the operational concept for a satellite-based communications product is quite different from one based on landlines. Since the alternative solutions have not usually been defined when preparing the initial operational concepts, conceptual solutions are developed for use when analyzing the requirements. The operational concepts are refined as solution decisions are made and lower level detailed requirements are developed.

Just as a design decision for a product may become a requirement for product components, the operational concept may become the scenarios (requirements) for product components. Operational concepts and scenarios are evolved to facilitate the selection of product component solutions that, when implemented, will satisfy the intended use of the product. Operational concepts and scenarios document the interaction of the product components with the environment, users, and other product components, regardless of engineering discipline. They should be documented for all modes and states within operations, product deployment, delivery, support (including maintenance and sustainment), training, and disposal.

The scenarios may include operational sequences, provided those sequences are an expression of customer requirements rather than operational concepts.

Typical Work Products

1.    Operational concept

2.    Product or product component installation, operational, maintenance, and support concepts

3.    Disposal concepts

4.    Use cases

5.    Timeline scenarios

6.    New requirements

Subpractices

1.    Develop operational concepts and scenarios that include functionality, performance, maintenance, support, and disposal as appropriate.

Identify and develop scenarios, consistent with the level of detail in the stakeholder needs, expectations, and constraints in which the proposed product or product component is expected to operate.

2.    Define the environment in which the product or product component will operate, including boundaries and constraints.

3.    Review operational concepts and scenarios to refine and discover requirements.

Operational concept and scenario development is an iterative process. The reviews should be held periodically to ensure that they agree with the requirements. The review may be in the form of a walkthrough.

4.   Develop a detailed operational concept, as products and product components are selected, that defines the interaction of the product, the end user, and the environment, and that satisfies the operational, maintenance, support, and disposal needs.
SP 3.2         Establish a Definition of Required Functionality

Establish and maintain a definition of required functionality.

The definition of functionality, also referred to as “functional analysis,” is the description of what the product is intended to do. The definition of functionality can include actions, sequence, inputs, outputs, or other information that communicates the manner in which the product will be used.

Functional analysis is not the same as structured analysis in software development and does not presume a functionally oriented software design. In object-oriented software design, it relates to defining what are called “services” or “methods.” The definition of functions, their logical groupings, and their association with requirements is referred to as a functional architecture. (See the definition of “functional architecture” in the glossary.)

Typical Work Products

1.    Functional architecture

2.    Activity diagrams and use cases

3.    Object-oriented analysis with services or methods identified

Subpractices

1.    Analyze and quantify functionality required by end users.

2.    Analyze requirements to identify logical or functional partitions (e.g., subfunctions).

3.    Partition requirements into groups, based on established criteria (e.g., similar functionality, performance, or coupling), to facilitate and focus the requirements analysis.

4.    Consider the sequencing of time-critical functions both initially and subsequently during product component development.

5.    Allocate customer requirements to functional partitions, objects, people, or support elements to support the synthesis of solutions.

6.    Allocate functional and performance requirements to functions and subfunctions.
SP 3.3         Analyze Requirements

Analyze requirements to ensure that they are necessary and sufficient.

In light of the operational concept and scenarios, the requirements for one level of the product hierarchy are analyzed to determine whether they are necessary and sufficient to meet the objectives of higher levels of the product hierarchy. The analyzed requirements then provide the basis for more detailed and precise requirements for lower levels of the product hierarchy.

As requirements are defined, their relationship to higher level requirements and the higher level defined functionality must be understood. One of the other actions is the determination of which key requirements will be used to track progress. For instance, the weight of a product or size of a software product may be monitored through development based on its risk.

Refer to the Verification process area for more information about verification methods that could be used to support this analysis.

Typical Work Products

1.    Requirements defects reports

2.    Proposed requirements changes to resolve defects

3.    Key requirements

4.    Technical performance measures

Subpractices

1.    Analyze stakeholder needs, expectations, constraints, and external interfaces to remove conflicts and to organize into related subjects.

2.    Analyze requirements to determine whether they satisfy the objectives of higher level requirements.

3.    Analyze requirements to ensure that they are complete, feasible, realizable, and verifiable.

While design determines the feasibility of a particular solution, this subpractice addresses knowing which requirements affect feasibility.

4.   Identify key requirements that have a strong influence on cost, schedule, functionality, risk, or performance.

5.    Identify technical performance measures that will be tracked during the development effort.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for more information about the use of measurements.

6.    Analyze operational concepts and scenarios to refine the customer needs, constraints, and interfaces and to discover new requirements.

This analysis may result in more detailed operational concepts and scenarios as well as supporting the derivation of new requirements.
SP 3.4         Analyze Requirements to Achieve Balance

Analyze requirements to balance stakeholder needs and constraints.

Stakeholder needs and constraints can address cost, schedule, performance, functionality, reusable components, maintainability, or risk.

Typical Work Products

1.    Assessment of risks related to requirements

Subpractices

1.    Use proven models, simulations, and prototyping to analyze the balance of stakeholder needs and constraints.

Results of the analyses can be used to reduce the cost of the product and the risk in developing the product.

2.    Perform a risk assessment on the requirements and functional architecture.

Refer to the Risk Management process area for information about performing a risk assessment on customer and product requirements and the functional architecture.

3.    Examine product lifecycle concepts for impacts of requirements on risks.
SP 3.5         Validate Requirements

Validate requirements to ensure the resulting product will perform as intended in the user's environment.

Requirements validation is performed early in the development effort with end users to gain confidence that the requirements are capable of guiding a development that results in successful final validation. This activity should be integrated with risk management activities. Mature organizations will typically perform requirements validation in a more sophisticated way using multiple techniques and will broaden the basis of the validation to include other stakeholder needs and expectations.
Examples of techniques used for requirements validation include the following:

·         Analysis

·         Simulations

·         Prototyping

·         Demonstrations

 

Typical Work Products

1.    Record of analysis methods and results

Subpractices

1.    Analyze the requirements to determine the risk that the resulting product will not perform appropriately in its intended-use environment.

2.    Explore the adequacy and completeness of requirements by developing product representations (e.g., prototypes, simulations, models, scenarios, and storyboards) and by obtaining feedback about them from relevant stakeholders.

Refer to the Validation process area for information about preparing for and performing validation on products and product components.

3.    Assess the design as it matures in the context of the requirements validation environment to identify validation issues and expose unstated needs and customer requirements.

[Requirements Management]()

An Engineering Process Area at Maturity Level 2

Purpose

The purpose of Requirements Management (REQM) is to manage the requirements of the project’s products and product components and to identify inconsistencies between those requirements and the project’s plans and work products.

Introductory Notes

Requirements management processes manage all requirements received or generated by the project, including both technical and nontechnical requirements as well as those requirements levied on the project by the organization. In particular, if the Requirements Development process area is implemented, its processes will generate product and product component requirements that will also be managed by the requirements management processes. Throughout the process areas, where we use the terms product and product component, their intended meanings also encompass services and their components. When the Requirements Management, Requirements Development, and Technical Solution process areas are all implemented, their associated processes may be closely tied and be performed concurrently.

The project takes appropriate steps to ensure that the agreed-on set of requirements is managed to support the planning and execution needs of the project. When a project receives requirements from an approved requirements provider, the requirements are reviewed with the requirements provider to resolve issues and prevent misunderstanding before the requirements are incorporated into the project’s plans. Once the requirements provider and the requirements receiver reach an agreement, commitment to the requirements is obtained from the project participants. The project manages changes to the requirements as they evolve and identifies any inconsistencies that occur among the plans, work products, and requirements.

Part of the management of requirements is to document requirements changes and rationale and to maintain bidirectional traceability between source requirements and all product and product component requirements (See the definition of “bidirectional traceability” in the glossary.)

All development projects have requirements. In the case of a project that is focused on maintenance activities, the changes to the product or product components are based on changes to the existing requirements, design, or implementation. The requirements changes, if any, might be documented in change requests from the customer or users, or they might take the form of new requirements received from the requirements development process. Regardless of their source or form, the maintenance activities that are driven by changes to requirements are managed accordingly.

To avoid requirements creep, criteria are established to designate appropriate channels, or official sources, from which to receive requirements. The receiving activities conduct analyses of the requirements with the requirements provider to ensure that a compatible, shared understanding is reached on the meaning of the requirements. The result of this analysis and dialog is an agreed-to set of requirements.

Typical Work Products

1.    Lists of criteria for distinguishing appropriate requirements providers

2.    Criteria for evaluation and acceptance of requirements

3.    Results of analyses against criteria

4.    An agreed-to set of requirements

Subpractices

1.    Establish criteria for distinguishing appropriate requirements providers.

2.    Establish objective criteria for the evaluation and acceptance of requirements.

Lack of evaluation and acceptance criteria often results in inadequate verification, costly rework, or customer rejection.
Examples of evaluation and acceptance criteria include the following:

·       Clearly and properly stated

·       Complete

·       Consistent with each other

·       Uniquely identified

·       Appropriate to implement

·       Verifiable (testable)

·       Traceable

 

3.    Analyze requirements to ensure that the established criteria are met.

4.    Reach an understanding of the requirements with the requirements provider so that the project participants can commit to them.
SP 1.2         Obtain Commitment to Requirements

Obtain commitment to the requirements from the project participants.

Refer to the Project Monitoring and Control process area for more information about monitoring the commitments made.

 
IPPD Addition

When integrated teams are formed, the project participants are the integrated teams and their members. Commitment to the requirement for interacting with other integrated teams is as important for each integrated team as its commitments to product and other project requirements.

 

Whereas the previous specific practice dealt with reaching an understanding with the requirements providers, this specific practice deals with agreements and commitments among those who have to carry out the activities necessary to implement the requirements. Requirements evolve throughout the project, especially as described by the specific practices of the Requirements Development process area and the Technical Solution process area. As the requirements evolve, this specific practice ensures that project participants commit to the current, approved requirements and the resulting changes in project plans, activities, and work products.

Typical Work Products

1.    Requirements impact assessments

2.    Documented commitments to requirements and requirements changes

Subpractices

1.    Assess the impact of requirements on existing commitments.

The impact on the project participants should be evaluated when the requirements change or at the start of a new requirement.

2.    Negotiate and record commitments.

Changes to existing commitments should be negotiated before project participants commit to the requirement or requirement change.
SP 1.3         Manage Requirements Changes

Manage changes to the requirements as they evolve during the project.

Refer to the Configuration Management process area for more information about maintaining and controlling the requirements baseline and on making the requirements and change data available to the project.

During the project, requirements change for a variety of reasons. As needs change and as work proceeds, additional requirements are derived and changes may have to be made to the existing requirements. It is essential to manage these additions and changes efficiently and effectively. To effectively analyze the impact of the changes, it is necessary that the source of each requirement is known and the rationale for any change is documented. The project manager may, however, want to track appropriate measures of requirements volatility to judge whether new or revised controls are necessary.

Typical Work Products

1.    Requirements status

2.    Requirements database

3.    Requirements decision database

Subpractices

1.    Document all requirements and requirements changes that are given to or generated by the project.

2.    Maintain the requirements change history with the rationale for the changes.

Maintaining the change history helps track requirements volatility.

3.    Evaluate the impact of requirement changes from the standpoint of relevant stakeholders.

4.    Make the requirements and change data available to the project.
SP 1.4         Maintain Bidirectional Traceability of Requirements

Maintain bidirectional traceability among the requirements and work products.

The intent of this specific practice is to maintain the bidirectional traceability of requirements for each level of product decomposition. (See the definition of “bidirectional traceability” in the glossary.) When the requirements are managed well, traceability can be established from the source requirement to its lower level requirements and from the lower level requirements back to their source. Such bidirectional traceability helps determine that all source requirements have been completely addressed and that all lower level requirements can be traced to a valid source.

Requirements traceability can also cover the relationships to other entities such as intermediate and final work products, changes in design documentation, and test plans. The traceability can cover horizontal relationships, such as across interfaces, as well as vertical relationships. Traceability is particularly needed in conducting the impact assessment of requirements changes on the project's activities and work products.

Typical Work Products

1.    Requirements traceability matrix

2.    Requirements tracking system

Subpractices

1.    Maintain requirements traceability to ensure that the source of lower level (derived) requirements is documented.

2.    Maintain requirements traceability from a requirement to its derived requirements and allocation to functions, interfaces, objects, people, processes, and work products.

3.    Generate the requirements traceability matrix.
SP 1.5         Identify Inconsistencies Between Project Work and Requirements

Identify inconsistencies between the project plans and work products and the requirements.

Refer to the Project Monitoring and Control process area for more information about monitoring and controlling the project plans and work products for consistency with requirements and taking corrective actions when necessary.

This specific practice finds the inconsistencies between the requirements and the project plans and work products and initiates the corrective action to fix them.

Typical Work Products

1.    Documentation of inconsistencies including sources, conditions, and rationale

2.    Corrective actions

Subpractices

1.    Review the project’s plans, activities, and work products for consistency with the requirements and the changes made to them.

2.    Identify the source of the inconsistency and the rationale.

3.    Identify changes that need to be made to the plans and work products resulting from changes to the requirements baseline.

4.    Initiate corrective actions.

[Risk Management]()

A Project Management Process Area at Maturity Level 3

Purpose

The purpose of Risk Management (RSKM) is to identify potential problems before they occur so that risk-handling activities can be planned and invoked as needed across the life of the product or project to mitigate adverse impacts on achieving objectives.

Introductory Notes

Risk management is a continuous, forward-looking process that is an important part of management. Risk management should address issues that could endanger achievement of critical objectives. A continuous risk management approach is applied to effectively anticipate and mitigate the risks that may have a critical impact on the project.

Effective risk management includes early and aggressive risk identification through the collaboration and involvement of relevant stakeholders, as described in the stakeholder involvement plan addressed in the Project Planning process area. Strong leadership across all relevant stakeholders is needed to establish an environment for the free and open disclosure and discussion of risk.

Risk management must consider both internal and external sources for cost, schedule, and performance risk as well as other risks. Early and aggressive detection of risk is important because it is typically easier, less costly, and less disruptive to make changes and correct work efforts during the earlier, rather than the later, phases of the project.

Risk management can be divided into three parts: defining a risk management strategy; identifying and analyzing risks; and handling identified risks, including the implementation of risk mitigation plans when needed.

As represented in the Project Planning and Project Monitoring and Control process areas, organizations may initially focus simply on risk identification for awareness, and react to the realization of these risks as they occur. The Risk Management process area describes an evolution of these specific practices to systematically plan, anticipate, and mitigate risks to proactively minimize their impact on the project.

Although the primary emphasis of the Risk Management process area is on the project, the concepts can also be applied to manage organizational risks.

Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Prepare for Risk Management

Preparation for risk management is conducted.

Preparation is conducted by establishing and maintaining a strategy for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating risks. This is typically documented in a risk management plan. The risk management strategy addresses the specific actions and management approach used to apply and control the risk management program. This includes identifying the sources of risk; the scheme used to categorize risks; and the parameters used to evaluate, bound, and control risks for effective handling.
SP 1.1         Determine Risk Sources and Categories

Determine risk sources and categories.

Identification of risk sources provides a basis for systematically examining changing situations over time to uncover circumstances that impact the ability of the project to meet its objectives. Risk sources are both internal and external to the project. As the project progresses, additional sources of risk may be identified. Establishing categories for risks provides a mechanism for collecting and organizing risks as well as ensuring appropriate scrutiny and management attention for those risks that can have more serious consequences on meeting project objectives.

Typical Work Products

1.    Risk source lists (external and internal)

2.    Risk categories list

Subpractices

1.    Determine risk sources.

Risk sources are the fundamental drivers that cause risks within a project or organization. There are many sources of risks, both internal and external, to a project. Risk sources identify common areas where risks may originate. Typical internal and external risk sources include the following:

·       Uncertain requirements

·       Unprecedented efforts—estimates unavailable

·       Infeasible design

·       Unavailable technology

·       Unrealistic schedule estimates or allocation

·       Inadequate staffing and skills

·       Cost or funding issues

·       Uncertain or inadequate subcontractor capability

·       Uncertain or inadequate vendor capability

·       Inadequate communication with actual or potential customers or with their representatives

·       Disruptions to continuity of operations

Many of these sources of risk are often accepted without adequate planning. Early identification of both internal and external sources of risk can lead to early identification of risks. Risk mitigation plans can then be implemented early in the project to preclude occurrence of the risks or reduce the consequences of their occurrence.

2.    Determine risk categories.

Risk categories reflect the “bins” for collecting and organizing risks. A reason for identifying risk categories is to help in the future consolidation of the activities in the risk mitigation plans.
The following factors may be considered when determining risk categories:

·       The phases of the project’s lifecycle model (e.g., requirements, design, manufacturing, test and evaluation, delivery, and disposal)

·       The types of processes used

·       The types of products used

·       Program management risks (e.g., contract risks, budget/cost risks, schedule risks, resources risks, performance risks, and supportability risks)

 

A risk taxonomy can be used to provide a framework for determining risk sources and categories.
SP 1.2         Define Risk Parameters

Define the parameters used to analyze and categorize risks, and the parameters used to control the risk management effort.

Parameters for evaluating, categorizing, and prioritizing risks include the following:

·         Risk likelihood (i.e., probability of risk occurrence)

·         Risk consequence (i.e., impact and severity of risk occurrence)

·         Thresholds to trigger management activities

Risk parameters are used to provide common and consistent criteria for comparing the various risks to be managed. Without these parameters, it would be very difficult to gauge the severity of the unwanted change caused by the risk and to prioritize the necessary actions required for risk mitigation planning.

Typical Work Products

1.    Risk evaluation, categorization, and prioritization criteria

2.    Risk management requirements (e.g., control and approval levels, and reassessment intervals)

Subpractices

1.    Define consistent criteria for evaluating and quantifying risk likelihood and severity levels.

Consistently used criteria (e.g., the bounds on the likelihood and severity levels) allow the impacts of different risks to be commonly understood, to receive the appropriate level of scrutiny, and to obtain the management attention warranted. In managing dissimilar risks (e.g., personnel safety versus environmental pollution), it is important to ensure consistency in end result (e.g., a high risk of environmental pollution is as important as a high risk to personnel safety).

2.    Define thresholds for each risk category.

For each risk category, thresholds can be established to determine acceptability or unacceptability of risks, prioritization of risks, or triggers for management action.
Examples of thresholds include the following:

·       Project-wide thresholds could be established to involve senior management when product costs exceed 10 percent of the target cost or when Cost Performance Indexes (CPIs) fall below 0.95.

·       Schedule thresholds could be established to involve senior management when Schedule Performance Indexes (SPIs) fall below 0.95.

·       Performance thresholds could be set to involve senior management when specified key items (e.g., processor utilization or average response times) exceed 125 percent of the intended design.

 

These may be refined later, for each identified risk, to establish points at which more aggressive risk monitoring is employed or to signal the implementation of risk mitigation plans.

3.    Define bounds on the extent to which thresholds are applied against or within a category.

There are few limits to which risks can be assessed in either a quantitative or qualitative fashion. Definition of bounds (or boundary conditions) can be used to help scope the extent of the risk management effort and avoid excessive resource expenditures. Bounds may include exclusion of a risk source from a category. These bounds can also exclude any condition that occurs less than a given frequency.
SP 1.3         Establish a Risk Management Strategy

Establish and maintain the strategy to be used for risk management.

A comprehensive risk management strategy addresses items such as the following:

·         The scope of the risk management effort

·         Methods and tools to be used for risk identification, risk analysis, risk mitigation, risk monitoring, and communication

·         Project-specific sources of risks

·         How these risks are to be organized, categorized, compared, and consolidated

·         Parameters, including likelihood, consequence, and thresholds, for taking action on identified risks

·         Risk mitigation techniques to be used, such as prototyping, piloting, simulation, alternative designs, or evolutionary development

·         Definition of risk measures to monitor the status of the risks

·         Time intervals for risk monitoring or reassessment

The risk management strategy should be guided by a common vision of success that describes the desired future project outcomes in terms of the product that is delivered, its cost, and its fitness for the task. The risk management strategy is often documented in an organizational or a project risk management plan. The risk management strategy is reviewed with relevant stakeholders to promote commitment and understanding.

Typical Work Products

1.    Project risk management strategy
SG 2            Identify and Analyze Risks

Risks are identified and analyzed to determine their relative importance.

The degree of risk impacts the resources assigned to handle an identified risk and the determination of when appropriate management attention is required.

Analyzing risks entails identifying risks from the internal and external sources identified and then evaluating each identified risk to determine its likelihood and consequences. Categorization of the risk, based on an evaluation against the established risk categories and criteria developed for the risk management strategy, provides the information needed for risk handling. Related risks may be grouped for efficient handling and effective use of risk management resources.
SP 2.1         Identify Risks

Identify and document the risks.

 
IPPD Addition

The particular risks associated with conducting the project using integrated teams should be considered, such as risks associated with loss of inter-team or intra-team coordination.

 

 

The identification of potential issues, hazards, threats, and vulnerabilities that could negatively affect work efforts or plans is the basis for sound and successful risk management. Risks must be identified and described in an understandable way before they can be analyzed and managed properly. Risks are documented in a concise statement that includes the context, conditions, and consequences of risk occurrence.

Risk identification should be an organized, thorough approach to seek out probable or realistic risks in achieving objectives. To be effective, risk identification should not be an attempt to address every possible event regardless of how highly improbable it may be. Use of the categories and parameters developed in the risk management strategy, along with the identified sources of risk, can provide the discipline and streamlining appropriate to risk identification. The identified risks form a baseline to initiate risk management activities. The list of risks should be reviewed periodically to reexamine possible sources of risk and changing conditions to uncover sources and risks previously overlooked or nonexistent when the risk management strategy was last updated.

Risk identification activities focus on the identification of risks, not placement of blame. The results of risk identification activities are not used by management to evaluate the performance of individuals.

There are many methods for identifying risks. Typical identification methods include the following:

·         Examine each element of the project work breakdown structure to uncover risks.

·         Conduct a risk assessment using a risk taxonomy.

·         Interview subject matter experts.

·         Review risk management efforts from similar products.

·         Examine lessons-learned documents or databases.

·         Examine design specifications and agreement requirements.

Typical Work Products

1.    List of identified risks, including the context, conditions, and consequences of risk occurrence

Subpractices

1.    Identify the risks associated with cost, schedule, and performance.

Cost, schedule, and performance risks should be examined to the extent that they impact project objectives. There may be potential risks discovered that are outside the scope of the project’s objectives but vital to customer interests. For example, the risks in development costs, product acquisition costs, cost of spare (or replacement) products, and product disposition (or disposal) costs have design implications. The customer may not have considered the full cost of supporting a fielded product or using a delivered service. The customer should be informed of such risks, but actively managing those risks may not be necessary. The mechanisms for making such decisions should be examined at project and organization levels and put in place if deemed appropriate, especially for risks that impact the ability to verify and validate the product.

In addition to the cost risks identified above, other cost risks may include those associated with funding levels, funding estimates, and distributed budgets.

Schedule risks may include risks associated with planned activities, key events, and milestones.

Performance risks may include risks associated with the following:

·       Requirements

·       Analysis and design

·       Application of new technology

·       Physical size

·       Shape

·       Weight

·       Manufacturing and fabrication

·       Functional performance and operation

·       Verification

·       Validation

·       Performance maintenance attributes

Performance maintenance attributes are those characteristics that enable an in-use product or service to provide originally required performance, such as maintaining safety and security performance.

There are other risks that do not fall into cost, schedule, or performance categories.
Examples of these other risks include the following:

·       Risks associated with strikes

·       Diminishing sources of supply

·       Technology cycle time

·       Competition

 

2.    Review environmental elements that may impact the project.

Risks to a project that frequently are missed include those supposedly outside the scope of the project (i.e., the project does not control whether they occur but can mitigate their impact), such as weather, natural or manmade disasters that affect continuity of operations, political changes, and telecommunications failures.

3.    Review all elements of the work breakdown structure as part of identifying risks to help ensure that all aspects of the work effort have been considered.

4.    Review all elements of the project plan as part of identifying risks to help ensure that all aspects of the project have been considered.

Refer to the Project Planning process area for more information about identifying project risks.

5.    Document the context, conditions, and potential consequences of the risk.

Risks statements are typically documented in a standard format that contains the risk context, conditions, and consequences of occurrence. The risk context provides additional information such that the intent of the risk can be easily understood. In documenting the context of the risk, consider the relative time frame of the risk, the circumstances or conditions surrounding the risk that has brought about the concern, and any doubt or uncertainty.

6.    Identify the relevant stakeholders associated with each risk.
SP 2.2         Evaluate, Categorize, and Prioritize Risks

Evaluate and categorize each identified risk using the defined risk categories and parameters, and determine its relative priority.

The evaluation of risks is needed to assign relative importance to each identified risk, and is used in determining when appropriate management attention is required. Often it is useful to aggregate risks based on their interrelationships, and develop options at an aggregate level. When an aggregate risk is formed by a roll up of lower level risks, care must be taken to ensure that important lower level risks are not ignored.

Collectively, the activities of risk evaluation, categorization, and prioritization are sometimes called “risk assessment” or “risk analysis.”

Typical Work Products

1.    List of risks, with a priority assigned to each risk

Subpractices

1.    Evaluate the identified risks using the defined risk parameters.

Each risk is evaluated and assigned values in accordance with the defined risk parameters, which may include likelihood, consequence (severity, or impact), and thresholds. The assigned risk parameter values can be integrated to produce additional measures, such as risk exposure, which can be used to prioritize risks for handling.

Often, a scale with three to five values is used to evaluate both likelihood and consequence. Likelihood, for example, can be categorized as remote, unlikely, likely, highly likely, or a near certainty.
Examples for consequences include the following:

·       Low

·       Medium

·       High

·       Negligible

·       Marginal

·       Significant

·       Critical

·       Catastrophic

 

Probability values are frequently used to quantify likelihood. Consequences are generally related to cost, schedule, environmental impact, or human measures (e.g., labor hours lost and severity of injury).

This evaluation is often a difficult and time-consuming task. Specific expertise or group techniques may be needed to assess the risks and gain confidence in the prioritization. In addition, priorities may require reevaluation as time progresses.

2.    Categorize and group risks according to the defined risk categories.

Risks are categorized into the defined risk categories, providing a means to look at risks according to their source, taxonomy, or project component. Related or equivalent risks may be grouped for efficient handling. The cause-and-effect relationships between related risks are documented.

3.    Prioritize risks for mitigation.

A relative priority is determined for each risk based on the assigned risk parameters. Clear criteria should be used to determine the risk priority. The intent of prioritization is to determine the most effective areas to which resources for mitigation of risks can be applied with the greatest positive impact to the project.
SG 3            Mitigate Risks

Risks are handled and mitigated, where appropriate, to reduce adverse impacts on achieving objectives.

The steps in handling risks include developing risk-handling options, monitoring risks, and performing risk-handling activities when defined thresholds are exceeded. Risk mitigation plans are developed and implemented for selected risks to proactively reduce the potential impact of risk occurrence. This can also include contingency plans to deal with the impact of selected risks that may occur despite attempts to mitigate them. The risk parameters used to trigger risk-handling activities are defined by the risk management strategy.
SP 3.1         Develop Risk Mitigation Plans

Develop a risk mitigation plan for the most important risks to the project as defined by the risk management strategy.

A critical component of a risk mitigation plan is to develop alternative courses of action, workarounds, and fallback positions, with a recommended course of action for each critical risk. The risk mitigation plan for a given risk includes techniques and methods used to avoid, reduce, and control the probability of occurrence of the risk, the extent of damage incurred should the risk occur (sometimes called a “contingency plan”), or both. Risks are monitored and when they exceed the established thresholds, the risk mitigation plans are deployed to return the impacted effort to an acceptable risk level. If the risk cannot be mitigated, a contingency plan can be invoked. Both risk mitigation and contingency plans are often generated only for selected risks where the consequences of the risks are determined to be high or unacceptable; other risks may be accepted and simply monitored.

Options for handling risks typically include alternatives such as the following:

·         Risk avoidance: Changing or lowering requirements while still meeting the user’s needs

·         Risk control: Taking active steps to minimize risks

·         Risk transfer: Reallocating requirements to lower the risks

·         Risk monitoring: Watching and periodically reevaluating the risk for changes to the assigned risk parameters

·         Risk acceptance: Acknowledgment of risk but not taking any action

Often, especially for high risks, more than one approach to handling a risk should be generated.
For example, in the case of an event that disrupts continuity of operations, approaches to risk management can include the following:

·         Resource reserves to respond to disruptive events

·         Lists of appropriate back-up equipment to be available

·         Back-up personnel for key personnel

·         Plans and results of/for testing emergency response systems

·         Posted procedures for emergencies

·         Disseminated lists of key contacts and information resources for emergencies

 

In many cases, risks will be accepted or watched. Risk acceptance is usually done when the risk is judged too low for formal mitigation, or when there appears to be no viable way to reduce the risk. If a risk is accepted, the rationale for this decision should be documented. Risks are watched when there is an objectively defined, verifiable, and documented threshold of performance, time, or risk exposure (the combination of likelihood and consequence) that will trigger risk mitigation planning or invoke a contingency plan if it is needed.

Adequate consideration should be given early to technology demonstrations, models, simulations, pilots, and prototypes as part of risk mitigation planning.

Typical Work Products

1.    Documented handling options for each identified risk

2.    Risk mitigation plans

3.    Contingency plans

4.    List of those responsible for tracking and addressing each risk

Subpractices

1.    Determine the levels and thresholds that define when a risk becomes unacceptable and triggers the execution of a risk mitigation plan or a contingency plan.

Risk level (derived using a risk model) is a measure combining the uncertainty of reaching an objective with the consequences of failing to reach the objective.

Risk levels and thresholds that bound planned or acceptable performance must be clearly understood and defined to provide a means with which risk can be understood. Proper categorization of risk is essential for ensuring appropriate priority based on severity and the associated management response. There may be multiple thresholds employed to initiate varying levels of management response. Typically, thresholds for the execution of risk mitigation plans are set to engage before the execution of contingency plans.

2.    Identify the person or group responsible for addressing each risk.

3.    Determine the cost-to-benefit ratio of implementing the risk mitigation plan for each risk.

Risk mitigation activities should be examined for the benefits they provide versus the resources they will expend. Just like any other design activity, alternative plans may need to be developed and the costs and benefits of each alternative assessed. The most appropriate plan is then selected for implementation. At times the risk may be significant and the benefits small, but the risk must be mitigated to reduce the probability of incurring unacceptable consequences.

4.    Develop an overall risk mitigation plan for the project to orchestrate the implementation of the individual risk mitigation and contingency plans.

The complete set of risk mitigation plans may not be affordable. A tradeoff analysis should be performed to prioritize the risk mitigation plans for implementation.

5.    Develop contingency plans for selected critical risks in the event their impacts are realized.

Risk mitigation plans are developed and implemented as needed to proactively reduce risks before they become problems. Despite best efforts, some risks may be unavoidable and will become problems that impact the project. Contingency plans can be developed for critical risks to describe the actions a project may take to deal with the occurrence of this impact. The intent is to define a proactive plan for handling the risk, either to reduce the risk (mitigation) or respond to the risk (contingency), but in either event to manage the risk.

Some risk management literature may consider contingency plans a synonym or subset of risk mitigation plans. These plans also may be addressed together as risk-handling or risk action plans.
SP 3.2         Implement Risk Mitigation Plans

Monitor the status of each risk periodically and implement the risk mitigation plan as appropriate.

To effectively control and manage risks during the work effort, follow a proactive program to regularly monitor risks and the status and results of risk-handling actions. The risk management strategy defines the intervals at which the risk status should be revisited. This activity may result in the discovery of new risks or new risk-handling options that can require replanning and reassessment. In either event, the acceptability thresholds associated with the risk should be compared against the status to determine the need for implementing a risk mitigation plan.

Typical Work Products

1.    Updated lists of risk status

2.    Updated assessments of risk likelihood, consequence, and thresholds

3.    Updated lists of risk-handling options

4.    Updated list of actions taken to handle risks

5.    Risk mitigation plans

Subpractices

1.    Monitor risk status.

After a risk mitigation plan is initiated, the risk is still monitored. Thresholds are assessed to check for the potential execution of a contingency plan.

A periodic mechanism for monitoring should be employed.

2.    Provide a method for tracking open risk-handling action items to closure.

Refer to the Project Monitoring and Control process area for more information about tracking action items.

3.    Invoke selected risk-handling options when monitored risks exceed the defined thresholds.

Quite often, risk handling is only performed for those risks judged to be “high” and “medium.” The risk-handling strategy for a given risk may include techniques and methods to avoid, reduce, and control the likelihood of the risk or the extent of damage incurred should the risk (anticipated event or situation) occur or both. In this context, risk handling includes both risk mitigation plans and contingency plans.

Risk-handling techniques are developed to avoid, reduce, and control adverse impact to project objectives and to bring about acceptable outcomes in light of probable impacts. Actions generated to handle a risk require proper resource loading and scheduling within plans and baseline schedules. This replanning effort needs to closely consider the effects on adjacent or dependent work initiatives or activities.

Refer to the Project Monitoring and Control process area for more information about revising the project plan.

4.    Establish a schedule or period of performance for each risk-handling activity that includes the start date and anticipated completion date.

5.    Provide continued commitment of resources for each plan to allow successful execution of the risk-handling activities.

6.    Collect performance measures on the risk-handling activities.

[Supplier Agreement Management]()

A Project Management Process Area at Maturity Level 2

Purpose

The purpose of Supplier Agreement Management (SAM) is to manage the acquisition of products from suppliers.

Introductory Notes

The Supplier Agreement Management process area involves the following:

·         Determining the type of acquisition that will be used for the products to be acquired

·         Selecting suppliers

·         Establishing and maintaining agreements with suppliers

·         Executing the supplier agreement

·         Monitoring selected supplier processes

·         Evaluating selected supplier work products

·         Accepting delivery of acquired products

·         Transitioning acquired products to the project

This process area primarily addresses the acquisition of products and product components that are delivered to the project’s customer. Throughout the process areas, where we use the terms product and product component, their intended meanings also encompass services and their components.
Examples of products and product components that may be acquired by the project include the following:

·         Subsystems (e.g., navigational system on an airplane)

·         Software

·         Hardware

·         Documentation (e.g., installation, operator's, and user's manuals)

·         Parts and materials (e.g., gauges, switches, wheels, steel, and raw materials)

 

To minimize risks to the project, this process area can also address the acquisition of significant products and product components not delivered to the project’s customer but used to develop and maintain the product or service (for example, development tools and test environments).

Typically, the products to be acquired by the project are determined during the early stages of the planning and development of the product. The Technical Solution process area provides practices for determining the products and product components that may be acquired from suppliers.

This process area does not directly address arrangements in which the supplier is integrated into the project team and uses the same processes and reports to the same management as the product developers (for example, integrated teams). Typically, these situations are handled by other processes or functions, possibly external to the project, though some of the specific practices of this process area may be useful in managing the formal agreement with such a supplier.

Suppliers may take many forms depending on business needs, including in-house vendors (i.e., vendors that are in the same organization but are external to the project), fabrication capabilities and laboratories, and commercial vendors. (See the definition of “supplier” in the glossary.)

A formal agreement is established to manage the relationship between the organization and the supplier. A formal agreement is any legal agreement between the organization (representing the project) and the supplier. This agreement may be a contract, license, service level agreement, or memorandum of agreement. The acquired product is delivered to the project from the supplier according to this formal agreement (also known as the “supplier agreement”).

Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Establish Supplier Agreements

Agreements with the suppliers are established and maintained.
SP 1.1         Determine Acquisition Type

Determine the type of acquisition for each product or product component to be acquired.

Refer to the Technical Solution process area for more information about identifying the products and product components to be acquired.

There are many different types of acquisition that can be used to acquire products and product components that will be used by the project.
Examples of types of acquisition include the following:

·         Purchasing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products

·         Obtaining products through a contractual agreement

·         Obtaining products from an in-house vendor

·         Obtaining products from the customer

·         Combining some of the above (e.g., contracting for a modification to a COTS product or having another part of the business enterprise codevelop products with an external supplier)

 

In the event that COTS products are desired, care in evaluating and selecting these products and the vendor may be critical to the project. Things to consider in the selection decision include proprietary issues and the availability of the products.

Typical Work Products

1.    List of the acquisition types that will be used for all products and product components to be acquired
SP 1.2         Select Suppliers

Select suppliers based on an evaluation of their ability to meet the specified requirements and established criteria.

Refer to the Decision Analysis and Resolution process area for more information about formal evaluation approaches that can be used to select suppliers.

Refer to the Requirements Management process area for more information about specified requirements.

Criteria should be established to address factors that are important to the project.
Examples of factors include the following:

·         Geographical location of the supplier

·         Supplier’s performance records on similar work

·         Engineering capabilities

·         Staff and facilities available to perform the work

·         Prior experience in similar applications

 

Typical Work Products

1.    Market studies

2.    List of candidate suppliers

3.    Preferred supplier list

4.    Trade study or other record of evaluation criteria, advantages and disadvantages of candidate suppliers, and rationale for selection of suppliers

5.    Solicitation materials and requirements

Subpractices

1.    Establish and document criteria for evaluating potential suppliers.

2.    Identify potential suppliers and distribute solicitation material and requirements to them.

A proactive manner of performing this activity is to conduct market research to identify potential sources of candidate products to be acquired, including candidates from suppliers of custom-made products and vendors of COTS products.

Refer to the Organizational Innovation and Deployment process area for examples of sources of process and technology improvements and how to pilot and evaluate such improvements.

3.    Evaluate proposals according to evaluation criteria.

4.    Evaluate risks associated with each proposed supplier.

Refer to the Risk Management process area for more information about evaluating project risks.

5.    Evaluate proposed suppliers' ability to perform the work.
Examples of methods to evaluate the proposed supplier’s ability to perform the work include the following:

·       Evaluation of prior experience in similar applications

·       Evaluation of prior performance on similar work

·       Evaluation of management capabilities

·       Capability evaluations

·       Evaluation of staff available to perform the work

·       Evaluation of available facilities and resources

·       Evaluation of the project’s ability to work with the proposed supplier

·       Evaluation of the impact of candidate COTS products on the project's plan and commitments

 

When COTS products are being evaluated consider the following:

·       Cost of the COTS products

·       Cost and effort to incorporate the COTS products into the project

·       Security requirements

·       Benefits and impacts that may result from future product releases

 

Future releases of the COTS product may provide additional features that support planned or anticipated enhancements for the project, but may result in the supplier discontinuing support of its current release.

6.    Select the supplier.
SP 1.3         Establish Supplier Agreements

Establish and maintain formal agreements with the supplier.

 
IPPD Addition

When integrated teams are formed, team membership should be negotiated with suppliers and incorporated into the agreement. The agreement should identify any integrated decision making, reporting requirements (business and technical), and trade studies requiring supplier involvement. The supplier efforts should be orchestrated to support the IPPD efforts undertaken by the acquirer.

 

A formal agreement is any legal agreement between the organization (representing the project) and the supplier. This agreement may be a contract, license, service level agreement, or memorandum of agreement.

The content of the agreement should specify the reviews, monitoring, evaluations, and acceptance tests to be performed, if such activities are appropriate to the acquisition or product being acquired.

Typical Work Products

1.    Statements of work

2.    Contracts

3.    Memoranda of agreement

4.    Licensing agreement

Subpractices

1.    Revise the requirements (e.g., product requirements and service level requirements) to be fulfilled by the supplier to reflect negotiations with the supplier when necessary.

Refer to the Requirements Development process area for more information about revising requirements.

Refer to the Requirements Management process area for more information about managing changes to requirements.

2.    Document what the project will provide to the supplier.

Include the following:

·       Project-furnished facilities

·       Documentation

·       Services

3.    Document the supplier agreement.

The supplier agreement should include a statement of work, a specification, terms and conditions, a list of deliverables, a schedule, a budget, and a defined acceptance process.

This subpractice typically includes the following:

·       Establishing the statement of work, specification, terms and conditions, list of deliverables, schedule, budget, and acceptance process

·       Identifying who from the project and supplier are responsible and authorized to make changes to the supplier agreement

·       Identifying how requirements changes and changes to the supplier agreement are to be determined, communicated, and addressed

·       Identifying standards and procedures that will be followed

·       Identifying critical dependencies between the project and the supplier

·       Identifying the type and depth of project oversight of the supplier, procedures, and evaluation criteria to be used in monitoring supplier performance including selection of processes to be monitored and work products to be evaluated

·       Identifying the types of reviews that will be conducted with the supplier

·       Identifying the supplier’s responsibilities for ongoing maintenance and support of the acquired products

·       Identifying warranty, ownership, and usage rights for the acquired products

·       Identifying acceptance criteria

In some cases, selection of COTS products may require a supplier agreement in addition to the agreements in the product's license.
Examples of what could be covered in an agreement with a COTS supplier include the following:

·       Discounts for large quantity purchases

·       Coverage of relevant stakeholders under the licensing agreement, including project suppliers, team members, and the project's customer

·       Plans for future enhancements

·       On-site support, such as responses to queries and problem reports

·       Additional capabilities that are not in the product

·       Maintenance support, including support after the product is withdrawn from general availability

 

4.    Periodically review the supplier agreement to ensure it accurately reflects the project's relationship with the supplier and current risks and market conditions.

5.    Ensure that all parties to the agreement understand and agree to all requirements before implementing the agreement or any changes.

6.    Revise the supplier agreement as necessary to reflect changes to the supplier's processes or work products.

7.    Revise the project's plans and commitments, including changes to the project's processes or work products, as necessary to reflect the supplier agreement.

Refer to the Project Monitoring and Control process area for more information about revising the project plan.

·       Ensuring that relevant stakeholders participate

·       Conducting the review

·       Identifying, documenting, and tracking all action items to closure

·       Preparing and distributing to the relevant stakeholders a summary report of the review

3.    Conduct technical reviews with the supplier as defined in the supplier agreement.

Technical reviews typically include the following:

·       Providing the supplier with visibility into the needs and desires of the project’s customers and end users, as appropriate

·       Reviewing the supplier’s technical activities and verifying that the supplier’s interpretation and implementation of the requirements are consistent with the project’s interpretation

·       Ensuring that technical commitments are being met and that technical issues are communicated and resolved in a timely manner

·       Obtaining technical information about the supplier’s products

·       Providing appropriate technical information and support to the supplier

6.    Monitor risks involving the supplier and take corrective action as necessary.

Refer to the Project Monitoring and Control process area for more information about monitoring project risks.
SP 2.2         Monitor Selected Supplier Processes

Select, monitor, and analyze processes used by the supplier.

In situations where there must be tight alignment between some of the processes implemented by the supplier and those of the project, monitoring these processes will help prevent interface problems.

The selection must consider the impact of the supplier's processes on the project. On larger projects with significant subcontracts for development of critical components, monitoring of key processes is expected. For most vendor agreements where a product is not being developed or for smaller, less critical components, the selection process may determine that monitoring is not appropriate. Between these extremes, the overall risk should be considered in selecting processes to be monitored.

The processes selected for monitoring should include engineering, project management (including contracting), and support processes critical to successful project performance.

Monitoring, if not performed with adequate care, can at one extreme be invasive and burdensome, or at the other extreme be uninformative and ineffective. There should be sufficient monitoring to detect issues, as early as possible, that may affect the supplier's ability to satisfy the requirements of the supplier agreement.

Analyzing selected processes involves taking the data obtained from monitoring selected supplier processes and analyzing it to determine whether there are serious issues.

Typical Work Products

1.    List of processes selected for monitoring or rationale for non-selection

2.    Activity reports

3.    Performance reports

Refer to the Verification process area for more information about recording the results of verification and analyses.

Refer to the Project Monitoring and Control process area for more information about taking corrective action.
SP 2.3         Evaluate Selected Supplier Work Products

Select and evaluate work products from the supplier of custom-made products.

The scope of this specific practice is limited to suppliers providing the project with custom-made products, particularly those that present some risk to the program due to complexity or criticality. The intent of this specific practice is to evaluate selected work products produced by the supplier to help detect issues as early as possible that may affect the supplier's ability to satisfy the requirements of the agreement. The work products selected for evaluation should include critical products, product components, and work products that provide insight into quality issues as early as possible.

Typical Work Products

1.    List of work products selected for monitoring or rationale for non-selection

2.    Activity reports

3.    Discrepancy reports

[Technical Solution]()

An Engineering Process Area at Maturity Level 3

Purpose

The purpose of Technical Solution (TS) is to design, develop, and implement solutions to requirements. Solutions, designs, and implementations encompass products, product components, and product-related lifecycle processes either singly or in combination as appropriate.

Introductory Notes

The Technical Solution process area is applicable at any level of the product architecture and to every product, product component, and product-related lifecycle process. Throughout the process areas, where we use the terms product and product component, their intended meanings also encompass services and their components.

The process area focuses on the following:

·         Evaluating and selecting solutions (sometimes referred to as “design approaches,” “design concepts,” or “preliminary designs”) that potentially satisfy an appropriate set of allocated requirements

·         Developing detailed designs for the selected solutions (detailed in the context of containing all the information needed to manufacture, code, or otherwise implement the design as a product or product component)

·         Implementing the designs as a product or product component

Typically, these activities interactively support each other. Some level of design, at times fairly detailed, may be needed to select solutions. Prototypes or pilots may be used as a means of gaining sufficient knowledge to develop a technical data package or a complete set of requirements.

Technical Solution specific practices apply not only to the product and product components but also to product-related lifecycle processes. The product-related lifecycle processes are developed in concert with the product or product component. Such development may include selecting and adapting existing processes (including standard processes) for use as well as developing new processes.

Processes associated with the Technical Solution process area receive the product and product component requirements from the requirements management processes. The requirements management processes place the requirements, which originate in requirements development processes, under appropriate configuration management and maintain their traceability to previous requirements.

For a maintenance or sustainment project, the requirements in need of maintenance actions or redesign may be driven by user needs or latent defects in the product components. New requirements may arise from changes in the operating environment. Such requirements can be uncovered during verification of the product(s) where actual performance can be compared against the specified performance and unacceptable degradation can be identified. Processes associated with the Technical Solution process area should be used to perform the maintenance or sustainment design efforts.

Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Select Product Component Solutions

Product or product component solutions are selected from alternative solutions.

Alternative solutions and their relative merits are considered in advance of selecting a solution. Key requirements, design issues, and constraints are established for use in alternative solution analysis. Architectural features that provide a foundation for product improvement and evolution are considered. Use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product components are considered relative to cost, schedule, performance, and risk. COTS alternatives may be used with or without modification. Sometimes such items may require modifications to aspects such as interfaces or a customization of some of the features to better achieve product requirements.

One indicator of a good design process is that the design was chosen after comparing and evaluating it against alternative solutions. Decisions on architecture, custom development versus off the shelf, and product component modularization are typical of the design choices that are addressed. Some of these decisions may require the use of a formal evaluation process.

Refer to the Decision Analysis and Resolution process area for more information about the use of a formal evaluation process.

Sometimes the search for solutions examines alternative instances of the same requirements with no allocations needed for lower level product components. Such is the case at the bottom of the product architecture. There are also cases where one or more of the solutions are fixed (e.g., a specific solution is directed or available product components, such as COTS, are investigated for use).

In the general case, solutions are defined as a set. That is, when defining the next layer of product components, the solution for each of the product components in the set is established. The alternative solutions are not only different ways of addressing the same requirements, but they also reflect a different allocation of requirements among the product components comprising the solution set. The objective is to optimize the set as a whole and not the individual pieces. There will be significant interaction with processes associated with the Requirements Development process area to support the provisional allocations to product components until a solution set is selected and final allocations are established.

Product-related lifecycle processes are among the product component solutions that are selected from alternative solutions. Examples of these product-related lifecycle processes are the manufacturing, delivery, and support processes.
SP 1.1         Develop Alternative Solutions and Selection Criteria

Develop alternative solutions and selection criteria.

Refer to the Allocate Product Component Requirements specific practice in the Requirements Development process area for more information about obtaining allocations of requirements to solution alternatives for the product components.

Refer to the Decision Analysis and Resolution process area for more information about establishing criteria used in making decisions.

 
IPPD Addition

The activity of selecting alternative solutions and issues to be subject to decision analyses and trade studies is accomplished by the involvement of relevant stakeholders. These stakeholders represent both business and technical functions and the concurrent development of the product and the product-related lifecycle processes (e.g., manufacturing, support, training, verification, and disposal). In this way, important issues surface earlier in product development than with traditional serial development and can be addressed before they become costly mistakes.

 

Alternative solutions need to be identified and analyzed to enable the selection of a balanced solution across the life of the product in terms of cost, schedule, and performance. These solutions are based on proposed product architectures that address critical product qualities and span a design space of feasible solutions. Specific practices associated with the Develop the Design specific goal provide more information on developing potential product architectures that can be incorporated into alternative solutions for the product.

Alternative solutions frequently encompass alternative requirement allocations to different product components. These alternative solutions can also include the use of COTS solutions in the product architecture. Processes associated with the Requirements Development process area would then be employed to provide a more complete and robust provisional allocation of requirements to the alternative solutions.

Alternative solutions span the acceptable range of cost, schedule, and performance. The product component requirements are received and used along with design issues, constraints, and criteria to develop the alternative solutions. Selection criteria would typically address costs (e.g., time, people, and money), benefits (e.g., performance, capability, and effectiveness), and risks (e.g., technical, cost, and schedule). Considerations for alternative solutions and selection criteria include the following:

·         Cost of development, manufacturing, procurement, maintenance, and support, etc.

·         Performance

·         Complexity of the product component and product-related lifecycle processes

·         Robustness to product operating and use conditions, operating modes, environments, and variations in product-related lifecycle processes

·         Product expansion and growth

·         Technology limitations

·         Sensitivity to construction methods and materials

·         Risk

·         Evolution of requirements and technology

·         Disposal

·         Capabilities and limitations of end users and operators

·         Characteristics of COTS products

The considerations listed here are a basic set; organizations should develop screening criteria to narrow down the list of alternatives that are consistent with their business objectives. Product lifecycle cost, while being a desirable parameter to minimize, may be outside the control of development organizations. A customer may not be willing to pay for features that cost more in the short term but ultimately decrease cost over the life of the product. In such cases, customers should at least be advised of any potential for reducing lifecycle costs. The criteria used in selections of final solutions should provide a balanced approach to costs, benefits, and risks.

Typical Work Products

1.    Alternative solution screening criteria

2.    Evaluation reports of new technologies

3.    Alternative solutions

4.    Selection criteria for final selection

5.    Evaluation reports of COTS products

Subpractices

1.    Identify screening criteria to select a set of alternative solutions for consideration.

2.    Identify technologies currently in use and new product technologies for competitive advantage.

Refer to the Organizational Innovation and Deployment process area for more information about improving the organization’s technology.

The project should identify technologies applied to current products and processes and monitor the progress of currently used technologies throughout the life of the project. The project should identify, select, evaluate, and invest in new technologies to achieve competitive advantage. Alternative solutions could include newly developed technologies, but could also include applying mature technologies in different applications or to maintain current methods.

3.    Identify candidate COTS products that satisfy the requirements.

Refer to the Supplier Agreement Management process area for more information about evaluating suppliers.

These requirements include the following:

·       Functionality, performance, quality, and reliability

·       Terms and conditions of warranties for the products

·       Risk

·       Suppliers' responsibilities for ongoing maintenance and support of the products

4.    Generate alternative solutions.

5.    Obtain a complete requirements allocation for each alternative.

6.    Develop the criteria for selecting the best alternative solution.

Criteria should be included that address design issues for the life of the product, such as provisions for more easily inserting new technologies or the ability to better exploit commercial products. Examples include criteria related to open design or open architecture concepts for the alternatives being evaluated.
SP 1.2         Select Product Component Solutions

Select the product component solutions that best satisfy the criteria established.

Refer to the Allocate Product Component Requirements and Identify Interface Requirements specific practices of the Requirements Development process area for information on establishing the allocated requirements for product components and interface requirements among product components.

Selecting product components that best satisfy the criteria establishes the requirement allocations to product components. Lower level requirements are generated from the selected alternative and used to develop the product component design. Interface requirements among product components are described, primarily functionally. Physical interface descriptions are included in the documentation for interfaces to items and activities external to the product.

The description of the solutions and the rationale for selection are documented. The documentation evolves throughout development as solutions and detailed designs are developed and those designs are implemented. Maintaining a record of rationale is critical to downstream decision making. Such records keep downstream stakeholders from redoing work and provide insights to apply technology as it becomes available in applicable circumstances.

Typical Work Products

1.    Product component selection decisions and rationale

2.    Documented relationships between requirements and product components

3.    Documented solutions, evaluations, and rationale

Subpractices

1.    Evaluate each alternative solution/set of solutions against the selection criteria established in the context of the operating concepts and scenarios.

Develop timeline scenarios for product operation and user interaction for each alternative solution.

2.    Based on the evaluation of alternatives, assess the adequacy of the selection criteria and update these criteria as necessary.

3.    Identify and resolve issues with the alternative solutions and requirements.

4.    Select the best set of alternative solutions that satisfy the established selection criteria.

5.    Establish the requirements associated with the selected set of alternatives as the set of allocated requirements to those product components.

6.    Identify the product component solutions that will be reused or acquired.

Refer to the Supplier Agreement Management process area for more information about acquiring products and product components.

7.    Establish and maintain the documentation of the solutions, evaluations, and rationale.
SG 2            Develop the Design

Product or product component designs are developed.

Product or product component designs must provide the appropriate content not only for implementation, but also for other phases of the product lifecycle such as modification, reprocurement, maintenance, sustainment, and installation. The design documentation provides a reference to support mutual understanding of the design by relevant stakeholders and supports future changes to the design both during development and in subsequent phases of the product lifecycle. A complete design description is documented in a technical data package that includes a full range of features and parameters including form, fit, function, interface, manufacturing process characteristics, and other parameters. Established organizational or project design standards (e.g., checklists, templates, and object frameworks) form the basis for achieving a high degree of definition and completeness in design documentation.

 
IPPD Addition

The integrated teams develop the designs of the appropriate product-related lifecycle processes concurrently with the design of the product. These processes may be selected without modification from the organization’s set of standard processes, if appropriate.

 

 
SP 2.1         Design the Product or Product Component

Develop a design for the product or product component.

Product design consists of two broad phases that may overlap in execution: preliminary and detailed design. Preliminary design establishes product capabilities and the product architecture, including product partitions, product component identifications, system states and modes, major intercomponent interfaces, and external product interfaces. Detailed design fully defines the structure and capabilities of the product components.

Refer to the Requirements Development process area for more information about developing architecture requirements.

Architecture definition is driven from a set of architectural requirements developed during the requirements development processes. These requirements express the qualities and performance points that are critical to the success of the product. The architecture defines structural elements and coordination mechanisms that either directly satisfy requirements or support the achievement of the requirements as the details of the product design are established. Architectures may include standards and design rules governing development of product components and their interfaces as well as guidance to aid product developers. Specific practices in the Select Product Component Solutions specific goal contain more information about using product architectures as a basis for alternative solutions.

Architects postulate and develop a model of the product, making judgments about allocation of requirements to product components including hardware and software. Multiple architectures, supporting alternative solutions, may be developed and analyzed to determine the advantages and disadvantages in the context of the architectural requirements.

Operational concepts and scenarios are used to generate use cases and quality scenarios that are used to refine the architecture. They are also used as a means to evaluate the suitability of the architecture for its intended purpose during architecture evaluations, which are conducted periodically throughout product design.

Refer to the Establish Operational Concepts and Scenarios specific practice of the Requirements Development process area for information about developing operational concepts and scenarios used in architecture evaluation.
Examples of architecture definition tasks include the following:

·         Establishing the structural relations of partitions and rules regarding interfaces between elements within partitions, and between partitions

·         Identifying major internal interfaces and all external interfaces

·         Identifying product components and interfaces between them

·         Defining coordination mechanisms (e.g., for software and hardware)

·         Establishing infrastructure capabilities and services

·         Developing product component templates or classes and frameworks

·         Establishing design rules and authority for making decisions

·         Defining a process/thread model

·         Defining physical deployment of software to hardware

·         Identifying major reuse approaches and sources

 

During detailed design, the product architecture details are finalized, product components are completely defined, and interfaces are fully characterized. Product component designs may be optimized for certain qualities or performance characteristics. Designers may evaluate the use of legacy or COTS products for the product components. As the design matures, the requirements assigned to lower level product components are tracked to ensure that those requirements are satisfied.

Refer to the Requirements Management process area for more information about tracking requirements for product components.

 

For Software Engineering

Detailed design is focused on software product component development. The internal structure of product components is defined, data schemas are generated, algorithms are developed, and heuristics are established to provide product component capabilities that satisfy allocated requirements.

 

 

For Hardware Engineering

Detailed design is focused on product development of electronic, mechanical, electro-optical, and other hardware products and their components. Electrical schematics and interconnection diagrams are developed, mechanical and optical assembly models are generated, and fabrication and assembly processes are developed.

 

Typical Work Products

1.    Product architecture

2.    Product component designs

Subpractices

1.    Establish and maintain criteria against which the design can be evaluated.
Examples of attributes, in addition to expected performance, for which design criteria can be established, include the following:

·       Modular

·       Clear

·       Simple

·       Maintainable

·       Verifiable

·       Portable

·       Reliable

·       Accurate

·       Secure

·       Scalable

·       Usable

 

2.    Identify, develop, or acquire the design methods appropriate for the product.

Effective design methods can embody a wide range of activities, tools, and descriptive techniques. Whether a given method is effective or not depends on the situation. Two companies may have very effective design methods for products in which they specialize, but these methods may not be effective in cooperative ventures. Highly sophisticated methods are not necessarily effective in the hands of designers who have not been trained in the use of the methods.

Whether a method is effective also depends on how much assistance it provides the designer, and the cost effectiveness of that assistance. For example, a multiyear prototyping effort may not be appropriate for a simple product component but might be the right thing to do for an unprecedented, expensive, and complex product development. Rapid prototyping techniques, however, can be highly effective for many product components. Methods that use tools to ensure that a design will encompass all the necessary attributes needed to implement the product component design can be very effective. For example, a design tool that “knows” the capabilities of the manufacturing processes can allow the variability of the manufacturing process to be accounted for in the design tolerances.
Examples of techniques and methods that facilitate effective design include the following:

·       Prototypes

·       Structural models

·       Object-oriented design

·       Essential systems analysis

·       Entity relationship models

·       Design reuse

·       Design patterns

 

3.    Ensure that the design adheres to applicable design standards and criteria.
Examples of design standards include the following (some or all of these standards may be design criteria, particularly in circumstances where the standards have not been established):

·       Operator interface standards

·       Test Scenarios

·       Safety standards

·       Design constraints (e.g., electromagnetic compatibility, signal integrity, and environmental)

·       Production constraints

·       Design tolerances

·       Parts standards (e.g., production scrap and waste)

 

4.    Ensure that the design adheres to allocated requirements.

Identified COTS product components must be taken into account. For example, putting existing product components into the product architecture might modify the requirements and the requirements allocation.

5.    Document the design.
SP 2.2         Establish a Technical Data Package

Establish and maintain a technical data package.

A technical data package provides the developer with a comprehensive description of the product or product component as it is developed. Such a package also provides procurement flexibility in a variety of circumstances such as performance-based contracting or build to print.

The design is recorded in a technical data package that is created during preliminary design to document the architecture definition. This technical data package is maintained throughout the life of the product to record essential details of the product design. The technical data package provides the description of a product or product component (including product-related lifecycle processes if not handled as separate product components) that supports an acquisition strategy, or the implementation, production, engineering, and logistics support phases of the product lifecycle. The description includes the definition of the required design configuration and procedures to ensure adequacy of product or product component performance. It includes all applicable technical data such as drawings, associated lists, specifications, design descriptions, design databases, standards, performance requirements, quality assurance provisions, and packaging details. The technical data package includes a description of the selected alternative solution that was chosen for implementation.

A technical data package should include the following if such information is appropriate for the type of product and product component (for example, material and manufacturing requirements may not be useful for product components associated with software services or processes):

·         Product architecture description

·         Allocated requirements

·         Product component descriptions

·         Product-related lifecycle process descriptions, if not described as separate product components

·         Key product characteristics

·         Required physical characteristics and constraints

·         Interface requirements

·         Materials requirements (bills of material and material characteristics)

·         Fabrication and manufacturing requirements (for both the original equipment manufacturer and field support)

·         The verification criteria used to ensure that requirements have been achieved

·         Conditions of use (environments) and operating/usage scenarios, modes and states for operations, support, training, manufacturing, disposal, and verifications throughout the life of the product

·         Rationale for decisions and characteristics (requirements, requirement allocations, and design choices)

Because design descriptions can involve a very large amount of data and can be crucial to successful product component development, it is advisable to establish criteria for organizing the data and for selecting the data content. It is particularly useful to use the product architecture as a means of organizing this data and abstracting views that are clear and relevant to an issue or feature of interest. These views include the following:

·         Customers

·         Requirements

·         The environment

·         Functional

·         Logical

·         Security

·         Data

·         States/modes

·         Construction

·         Management

These views are documented in the technical data package.

Typical Work Products

1.    Technical data package

Subpractices

1.    Determine the number of levels of design and the appropriate level of documentation for each design level.

Determining the number of levels of product components (e.g., subsystem, hardware configuration item, circuit board, computer software configuration item [CSCI], computer software product component, and computer software unit) that require documentation and requirements traceability is important to manage documentation costs and to support integration and verification plans.

2.    Base detailed design descriptions on the allocated product component requirements, architecture, and higher level designs.

3.    Document the design in the technical data package.

4.    Document the rationale for key (i.e., significant effect on cost, schedule, or technical performance) decisions made or defined.

5.    Revise the technical data package as necessary.
SP 2.3         Design Interfaces Using Criteria

Design product component interfaces using established criteria.

Interface designs include the following:

·         Origination

·         Destination

·         Stimulus and data characteristics for software

·         Electrical, mechanical, and functional characteristics for hardware

·         Services lines of communication

The criteria for interfaces frequently reflect critical parameters that must be defined, or at least investigated, to ascertain their applicability. These parameters are often peculiar to a given type of product (e.g., software, mechanical, electrical, and service) and are often associated with safety, security, durability, and mission-critical characteristics.

Refer to the Identify Interface Requirements specific practice in the Requirements Development process area for more information about identifying product and product component interface requirements.

Typical Work Products

1.    Interface design specifications

2.    Interface control documents

3.    Interface specification criteria

4.    Rationale for selected interface design

Subpractices

1.    Define interface criteria.

These criteria can be a part of the organizational process assets.

Refer to the Organizational Process Definition process area for more information about establishing and maintaining organizational process assets.

2.    Identify interfaces associated with other product components.

3.    Identify interfaces associated with external items.

4.    Identify interfaces between product components and the product-related lifecycle processes.

For example, such interfaces could include those between a product component to be fabricated and the jigs and fixtures used to enable that fabrication during the manufacturing process.

5.    Apply the criteria to the interface design alternatives.

Refer to the Decision Analysis and Resolution process area for more information about identifying criteria and selecting alternatives based on those criteria.

6.    Document the selected interface designs and the rationale for the selection.
SP 2.4         Perform Make, Buy, or Reuse Analyses

Evaluate whether the product components should be developed, purchased, or reused based on established criteria.

The determination of what products or product components will be acquired is frequently referred to as a “make-or-buy analysis.” It is based on an analysis of the needs of the project. This make-or-buy analysis begins early in the project during the first iteration of design; continues during the design process; and is completed with the decision to develop, acquire, or reuse the product.

Refer to the Requirements Development process area for more information about determining the product and product component requirements.

Refer to the Requirements Management process area for more information about managing requirements.

Factors affecting the make-or-buy decision include the following:

·         Functions the products will provide and how these functions will fit into the project

·         Available project resources and skills

·         Costs of acquiring versus developing internally

·         Critical delivery and integration dates

·         Strategic business alliances, including high-level business requirements

·         Market research of available products, including COTS products

·         Functionality and quality of available products

·         Skills and capabilities of potential suppliers

·         Impact on core competencies

·         Licenses, warranties, responsibilities, and limitations associated with products being acquired

·         Product availability

·         Proprietary issues

·         Risk reduction

The make-or-buy decision can be conducted using a formal evaluation approach.

Refer to the Decision Analysis and Resolution process area for more information about defining criteria and alternatives and performing formal evaluations.

As technology evolves, so does the rationale for choosing to develop or purchase a product component. While complex development efforts may favor purchasing an off-the-shelf product component, advances in productivity and tools may provide an opposing rationale. Off-the-shelf products may have incomplete or inaccurate documentation and may or may not be supported in the future.

Once the decision is made to purchase an off-the-shelf product component, the requirements are used to establish a supplier agreement. There are times when “off the shelf” refers to an existing item that may not be readily available in the marketplace. For example, some types of aircraft and engines are not truly “off the shelf” but can be readily procured. In some cases the use of such nondeveloped items is because the specifics of the performance and other product characteristics expected need to be within the limits specified. In these cases, the requirements and acceptance criteria may need to be included in the supplier agreement and managed. In other cases, the off-the-shelf product is literally off the shelf (word processing software, for example) and there is no agreement with the supplier that needs to be managed.

Refer to the Supplier Agreement Management process area for more information about how to address the acquisition of the product components that will be purchased.

Typical Work Products

1.    Criteria for design and product component reuse

2.    Make-or-buy analyses

3.    Guidelines for choosing COTS product components

Subpractices

1.    Develop criteria for the reuse of product component designs.

2.    Analyze designs to determine if product components should be developed, reused, or purchased.

3.    Analyze implications for maintenance when considering purchased or nondevelopmental (e.g., COTS, government off the shelf, and reuse) items.
Examples of implications for maintenance include the following:

·       Compatibility with future releases of COTS products

·       Configuration management of vendor changes

·       Defects in the nondevelopment item and their resolution

·       Unplanned obsolescence

 

SG 3            Implement the Product Design

Product components, and associated support documentation, are implemented from their designs.

Product components are implemented from the designs established by the specific practices in the Develop the Design specific goal. The implementation usually includes unit testing of the product components before sending them to product integration and development of end-user documentation.
SP 3.1         Implement the Design

Implement the designs of the product components.

Once the design has been completed, it is implemented as a product component. The characteristics of that implementation depend on the type of product component.

Design implementation at the top level of the product hierarchy involves the specification of each of the product components at the next level of the product hierarchy. This activity includes the allocation, refinement, and verification of each product component. It also involves the coordination between the various product component development efforts.

Refer to the Requirements Development process area for more information about the allocation and refinement of requirements.

Refer to the Product Integration process area for more information about the management of interfaces and the integration of products and product components.
Example characteristics of this implementation are as follows:

·         Software is coded.

·         Data is documented.

·         Services are documented.

·         Electrical and mechanical parts are fabricated.

·         Product-unique manufacturing processes are put into operation.

·         Processes are documented.

·         Facilities are constructed.

·         Materials are produced (e.g., a product-unique material could be petroleum, oil, a lubricant, or a new alloy).

[Validation]()

An Engineering Process Area at Maturity Level 3

Purpose

The purpose of Validation (VAL) is to demonstrate that a product or product component fulfills its intended use when placed in its intended environment.

Introductory Notes

Validation activities can be applied to all aspects of the product in any of its intended environments, such as operation, training, manufacturing, maintenance, and support services. The methods employed to accomplish validation can be applied to work products as well as to the product and product components. (Throughout the process areas, where we use the terms product and product component, their intended meanings also encompass services and their components.) The work products (e.g., requirements, designs, and prototypes) should be selected on the basis of which are the best predictors of how well the product and product component will satisfy user needs and thus validation is performed early and incrementally throughout the product lifecycle.

The validation environment should represent the intended environment for the product and product components as well as represent the intended environment suitable for validation activities with work products.

Validation demonstrates that the product, as provided, will fulfill its intended use; whereas, verification addresses whether the work product properly reflects the specified requirements. In other words, verification ensures that “you built it right”; whereas, validation ensures that “you built the right thing.” Validation activities use approaches similar to verification (e.g., test, analysis, inspection, demonstration, or simulation). Often, the end users and other relevant stakeholders are involved in the validation activities. Both validation and verification activities often run concurrently and may use portions of the same environment.

Refer to the Verification process area for more information about verification activities.

Whenever possible, validation should be accomplished using the product or product component operating in its intended environment. The entire environment can be used or only part of it. However, validation issues can be discovered early in the life of the project using work products by involving relevant stakeholders. Validation activities for services can be applied to work products such as proposals, service catalogs, statements of work, and service records.

When validation issues are identified, they are referred to the processes associated with the Requirements Development, Technical Solution, or Project Monitoring and Control process areas for resolution.

The specific practices of this process area build on each other in the following way:

·         The Select Products for Validation specific practice enables the identification of the product or product component to be validated and the methods to be used to perform the validation.

·         The Establish the Validation Environment specific practice enables the determination of the environment that will be used to carry out the validation.

·         The Establish Validation Procedures and Criteria specific practice enables the development of validation procedures and criteria that are aligned with the characteristics of selected products, customer constraints on validation, methods, and the validation environment.

·         The Perform Validation specific practice enables the performance of validation according to the methods, procedures, and criteria.
Related Process Areas

Refer to the Requirements Development process area for more information about requirements validation.

Refer to the Technical Solution process area for more information about transforming requirements into product specifications and for corrective action when validation issues are identified that affect the product or product component design.

Refer to the Verification process area for more information about verifying that the product or product component meets its requirements.

Specific Goal and Practice Summary

SG 1 Prepare for Validation

SP 1.1       Select Products for Validation

SP 1.2       Establish the Validation Environment

SP 1.3       Establish Validation Procedures and Criteria

SG 2 Validate Product or Product Components

SP 2.1       Perform Validation

SP 2.2       Analyze Validation Results

 
Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Prepare for Validation

Preparation for validation is conducted.

Preparation activities include selecting products and product components for validation and establishing and maintaining the validation environment, procedures, and criteria. The items selected for validation may include only the product or it may include appropriate levels of the product components that are used to build the product. Any product or product component may be subject to validation, including replacement, maintenance, and training products, to name a few.

The environment required to validate the product or product component is prepared. The environment may be purchased or may be specified, designed, and built. The environments used for product integration and verification may be considered in collaboration with the validation environment to reduce cost and improve efficiency or productivity.
SP 1.1         Select Products for Validation

Select products and product components to be validated and the validation methods that will be used for each.

Products and product components are selected for validation on the basis of their relationship to user needs. For each product component, the scope of the validation (e.g., operational behavior, maintenance, training, and user interface) should be determined.
Examples of products and product components that can be validated include the following:

·         Product and product component requirements and designs

·         Product and product components (e.g., system, hardware units, software, and service documentation)

·         User interfaces

·         User manuals

·         Training materials

·         Process documentation

 

The requirements and constraints for performing validation are collected. Then, validation methods are selected based on their ability to demonstrate that user needs are satisfied. The validation methods not only define the approach to product validation, but also drive the needs for the facilities, equipment, and environments. This may result in the generation of lower level product component requirements that are handled by the requirements development processes. Derived requirements, such as interface requirements to test sets and test equipment, can be generated. These requirements are also passed to the requirements development processes to ensure that the product or product components can be validated in an environment that supports the methods.

Validation methods should be selected early in the life of the project so that they are clearly understood and agreed to by the relevant stakeholders.

The validation methods address the development, maintenance, support, and training for the product or product component as appropriate.
Examples of validation methods include the following:

·         Discussions with the users, perhaps in the context of a formal review

·         Prototype demonstrations

·         Functional demonstrations (e.g., system, hardware units, software, service documentation, and user interfaces)

·         Pilots of training materials

·         Test of products and product components by end users and other relevant stakeholders

·         Analyses of product and product components (e.g., simulations, modeling, and user analyses)

 

 

For Hardware Engineering

Hardware validation activities include modeling to validate form, fit, and function of mechanical designs; thermal modeling; maintainability and reliability analysis; timeline demonstrations; and electrical design simulations of electronic or mechanical product components.

 

Typical Work Products

1.    Lists of products and product components selected for validation

2.    Validation methods for each product or product component

3.    Requirements for performing validation for each product or product component

4.    Validation constraints for each product or product component

Subpractices

1.    Identify the key principles, features, and phases for product or product component validation throughout the life of the project.

2.    Determine which categories of user needs (operational, maintenance, training, or support) are to be validated.

The product or product component must be maintainable and supportable in its intended operational environment. This specific practice also addresses the actual maintenance, training, and support services that may be delivered along with the product.
An example of evaluation of maintenance concepts in the operational environment is a demonstration that maintenance tools are operating with the actual product.

 

3.    Select the product and product components to be validated.

4.    Select the evaluation methods for product or product component validation.

5.    Review the validation selection, constraints, and methods with relevant stakeholders.
SP 1.2         Establish the Validation Environment

Establish and maintain the environment needed to support validation.

The requirements for the validation environment are driven by the product or product components selected, by the type of the work products (e.g., design, prototype, and final version), and by the methods of validation. These may yield requirements for the purchase or development of equipment, software, or other resources. These requirements are provided to the requirements development processes for development. The validation environment may include the reuse of existing resources. In this case, arrangements for the use of these resources must be made. Examples of the type of elements in a validation environment include the following:

·         Test tools interfaced with the product being validated (e.g., scope, electronic devices, and probes)

·         Temporary embedded test software

·         Recording tools for dump or further analysis and replay

·         Simulated subsystems or components (by software, electronics, or mechanics)

·         Simulated interfaced systems (e.g., a dummy warship for testing a naval radar)

·         Real interfaced systems (e.g., aircraft for testing a radar with trajectory tracking facilities)

·         Facilities and customer-supplied products

·         The skilled people to operate or use all the preceding elements

·         Dedicated computing or network test environment (e.g., pseudo-operational telecommunications-network testbed or facility with actual trunks, switches, and systems established for realistic integration and validation trials)

Early selection of the products or product components to be validated, the work products to be used in the validation, and the validation methods is needed to ensure that the validation environment will be available when necessary.

The validation environment should be carefully controlled to provide for replication, analysis of results, and revalidation of problem areas.

Typical Work Products

1.    Validation environment

Subpractices

1.    Identify validation environment requirements.

2.    Identify customer-supplied products.

3.    Identify reuse items.

4.    Identify test equipment and tools.

5.    Identify validation resources that are available for reuse and modification.

6.    Plan the availability of resources in detail.
SP 1.3         Establish Validation Procedures and Criteria

Establish and maintain procedures and criteria for validation.

Validation procedures and criteria are defined to ensure that the product or product component will fulfill its intended use when placed in its intended environment. Acceptance test cases and procedures may meet the need for validation procedures.

The validation procedures and criteria include test and evaluation of maintenance, training, and support services.
Examples of sources for validation criteria include the following:

·         Product and product component requirements

·         Standards

·         Customer acceptance criteria

·         Environmental performance

·         Thresholds of performance deviation

 

Typical Work Products

1.    Validation procedures

2.    Validation criteria

3.    Test and evaluation procedures for maintenance, training, and support

Subpractices

1.    Review the product requirements to ensure that issues affecting validation of the product or product component are identified and resolved.

2.    Document the environment, operational scenario, procedures, inputs, outputs, and criteria for the validation of the selected product or product component.

3.    Assess the design as it matures in the context of the validation environment to identify validation issues.
SG 2            Validate Product or Product Components

The product or product components are validated to ensure that they are suitable for use in their intended operating environment.

The validation methods, procedures, and criteria are used to validate the selected products and product components and any associated maintenance, training, and support services using the appropriate validation environment. Validation activities are performed throughout the product lifecycle.
SP 2.1         Perform Validation

Perform validation on the selected products and product components.

To be acceptable to users, a product or product component must perform as expected in its intended operational environment.

Validation activities are performed and the resulting data are collected according to the established methods, procedures, and criteria.

The as-run validation procedures should be documented and the deviations occurring during the execution should be noted, as appropriate.

Typical Work Products

1.    Validation reports

2.    Validation results

3.    Validation cross-reference matrix

4.    As-run procedures log

5.    Operational demonstrations
SP 2.2         Analyze Validation Results

Analyze the results of the validation activities.

The data resulting from validation tests, inspections, demonstrations, or evaluations are analyzed against the defined validation criteria. Analysis reports indicate whether the needs were met; in the case of deficiencies, these reports document the degree of success or failure and categorize probable cause of failure. The collected test, inspection, or review results are compared with established evaluation criteria to determine whether to proceed or to address requirements or design issues in the requirements development or technical solution processes.

Analysis reports or as-run validation documentation may also indicate that bad test results are due to a validation procedure problem or a validation environment problem.

Typical Work Products

1.    Validation deficiency reports

2.    Validation issues

3.    Procedure change request

Subpractices

1.    Compare actual results to expected results.

2.    Based on the established validation criteria, identify products and product components that do not perform suitably in their intended operating environments, or identify problems with the methods, criteria, and/or environment.

3.    Analyze the validation data for defects.

4.    Record the results of the analysis and identify issues.

5.    Use validation results to compare actual measurements and performance to intended use or operational need.

[Verification]()

An Engineering Process Area at Maturity Level 3

Purpose

The purpose of Verification (VER) is to ensure that selected work products meet their specified requirements.

Introductory Notes

The Verification process area involves the following: verification preparation, verification performance, and identification of corrective action.

Verification includes verification of the product and intermediate work products against all selected requirements, including customer, product, and product component requirements. Throughout the process areas, where we use the terms product and product component, their intended meanings also encompass services and their components.

Verification is inherently an incremental process because it occurs throughout the development of the product and work products, beginning with verification of the requirements, progressing through the verification of the evolving work products, and culminating in the verification of the completed product.

The specific practices of this process area build on each other in the following way:

·         The Select Work Products for Verification specific practice enables the identification of the work products to be verified, the methods to be used to perform the verification, and the requirements to be satisfied by each selected work product.

·         The Establish the Verification Environment specific practice enables the determination of the environment that will be used to carry out the verification.

·         The Establish Verification Procedures and Criteria specific practice then enables the development of verification procedures and criteria that are aligned with the selected work products, requirements, methods, and characteristics of the verification environment.

·         The Perform Verification specific practice conducts the verification according to the available methods, procedures, and criteria.

Verification of work products substantially increases the likelihood that the product will meet the customer, product, and product component requirements.

The Verification and Validation process areas are similar, but they address different issues. Validation demonstrates that the product, as provided (or as it will be provided), will fulfill its intended use, whereas verification addresses whether the work product properly reflects the specified requirements. In other words, verification ensures that “you built it right”; whereas, validation ensures that “you built the right thing.”

Peer reviews are an important part of verification and are a proven mechanism for effective defect removal. An important corollary is to develop a better understanding of the work products and the processes that produced them so that defects can be prevented and process improvement opportunities can be identified.

Peer reviews involve a methodical examination of work products by the producers’ peers to identify defects and other changes that are needed.
Examples of peer review methods include the following:

·         Inspections

·         Structured walkthroughs

Specific Practices by Goal

SG 1            Prepare for Verification

Preparation for verification is conducted.

Up-front preparation is necessary to ensure that verification provisions are embedded in product and product component requirements, designs, developmental plans, and schedules. Verification includes selection, inspection, testing, analysis, and demonstration of work products.

Methods of verification include, but are not limited to, inspections, peer reviews, audits, walkthroughs, analyses, simulations, testing, and demonstrations. Practices related to peer reviews as a specific verification method are included in specific goal 2.

Preparation also entails the definition of support tools, test equipment and software, simulations, prototypes, and facilities.
SP 1.1         Select Work Products for Verification

Select the work products to be verified and the verification methods that will be used for each.

Work products are selected based on their contribution to meeting project objectives and requirements, and to addressing project risks.

The work products to be verified may include those associated with maintenance, training, and support services. The work product requirements for verification are included with the verification methods. The verification methods address the approach to work product verification and the specific approaches that will be used to verify that specific work products meet their requirements.

 

For Software Engineering
Examples of verification methods include the following:

·  Path coverage testing

·  Load, stress, and performance testing

·  Decision-table-based testing

·  Functional decomposition-based testing

·  Test-case reuse

·  Acceptance tests

 

 

 

For Systems Engineering

Verification for systems engineering typically includes prototyping, modeling, and simulation to verify adequacy of system design (and allocation).

 

 

For Hardware Engineering

Verification for hardware engineering typically requires a parametric approach that considers various environmental conditions (e.g., pressure, temperature, vibration, and humidity), various input ranges (e.g., input power could be rated at 20V to 32V for a planned nominal of 28V), variations induced from part to part tolerance issues, and many other variables. Hardware verification normally tests most variables separately except when problematic interactions are suspected.

 

Selection of the verification methods typically begins with involvement in the definition of product and product component requirements to ensure that these requirements are verifiable. Reverification should be addressed by the verification methods to ensure that rework performed on work products does not cause unintended defects. Suppliers should be involved in this selection to ensure that the project's methods are appropriate for the supplier's environment.

 
IPPD Addition

The verification methods should be developed concurrently and iteratively with the product and product component designs.

SP 1.2         Establish the Verification Environment

Establish and maintain the environment needed to support verification.

An environment must be established to enable verification to take place. The verification environment can be acquired, developed, reused, modified, or a combination of these, depending on the needs of the project.

The type of environment required will depend on the work products selected for verification and the verification methods used. A peer review may require little more than a package of materials, reviewers, and a room. A product test may require simulators, emulators, scenario generators, data reduction tools, environmental controls, and interfaces with other systems.

The peer review is an important and effective verification method implemented via inspections, structured walkthroughs, or a number of other collegial review methods.

Peer reviews are primarily applied to work products developed by the projects, but they can also be applied to other work products such as documentation and training work products that are typically developed by support groups.
SP 2.1         Prepare for Peer Reviews

Prepare for peer reviews of selected work products.

Preparation activities for peer reviews typically include identifying the staff who will be invited to participate in the peer review of each work product; identifying the key reviewers who must participate in the peer review; preparing and updating any materials that will be used during the peer reviews, such as checklists and review criteria, and scheduling peer reviews.

Typical Work Products

1.    Peer review schedule

2.    Peer review checklist

3.    Entry and exit criteria for work products

4.    Criteria for requiring another peer review

5.    Peer review training material

6.    Selected work products to be reviewed

Subpractices

1.    Determine what type of peer review will be conducted.
Examples of types of peer reviews include the following:

·       Inspections

·       Structured walkthroughs

·       Active reviews

 

 

2.    Define requirements for collecting data during the peer review.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for information about identifying and collecting data.

3.    Establish and maintain entry and exit criteria for the peer review.

4.    Establish and maintain criteria for requiring another peer review.

5.    Establish and maintain checklists to ensure that the work products are reviewed consistently.
Examples of items addressed by the checklists include the following:

·       Rules of construction

·       Design guidelines

·       Completeness

·       Correctness

·       Maintainability

·       Common defect types

 

The checklists are modified as necessary to address the specific type of work product and peer review. The peers of the checklist developers and potential users review the checklists.

6.    Develop a detailed peer review schedule, including the dates for peer review training and for when materials for peer reviews will be available.

7.    Ensure that the work product satisfies the peer review entry criteria prior to distribution.

8.    Distribute the work product to be reviewed and its related information to the participants early enough to enable participants to adequately prepare for the peer review.

9.    Assign roles for the peer review as appropriate.
Examples of roles include the following:

·       Leader

·       Reader

·       Recorder

·       Author

 

10.  Prepare for the peer review by reviewing the work product prior to conducting the peer review.
SP 2.2         Conduct Peer Reviews

Conduct peer reviews on selected work products and identify issues resulting from the peer review.

One of the purposes of conducting a peer review is to find and remove defects early. Peer reviews are performed incrementally as work products are being developed. These reviews are structured and are not management reviews.

Peer reviews may be performed on key work products of specification, design, test, and implementation activities and specific planning work products.

The focus of the peer review should be on the work product in review, not on the person who produced it.

When issues arise during the peer review, they should be communicated to the primary developer of the work product for correction.

Refer to the Project Monitoring and Control process area for information about tracking issues that arise during a peer review.

Peer reviews should address the following guidelines: there must be sufficient preparation, the conduct must be managed and controlled, consistent and sufficient data must be recorded (an example is conducting a formal inspection), and action items must be recorded.

Typical Work Products

1.    Peer review results

2.    Peer review issues

3.    Peer review data

Subpractices

1.    Perform the assigned roles in the peer review.

2.    Identify and document defects and other issues in the work product.

3.    Record the results of the peer review, including the action items.

4.    Collect peer review data.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for more information about data collection.

5.    Identify action items and communicate the issues to relevant stakeholders.

6.    Conduct an additional peer review if the defined criteria indicate the need.

7.    Ensure that the exit criteria for the peer review are satisfied.
SP 2.3         Analyze Peer Review Data

Analyze data about preparation, conduct, and results of the peer reviews.

Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for more information about obtaining and analyzing data.

Typical Work Products

1.    Peer review data

2.    Peer review action items

Subpractices

1.    Record data related to the preparation, conduct, and results of the peer reviews.

Typical data are product name, product size, composition of the peer review team, type of peer review, preparation time per reviewer, length of the review meeting, number of defects found, type and origin of defect, and so on. Additional information on the work product being peer reviewed may be collected, such as size, development stage, operating modes examined, and requirements being evaluated.

2.    Store the data for future reference and analysis.

3.    Protect the data to ensure that peer review data are not used inappropriately.
Examples of inappropriate use of peer review data include using data to evaluate the performance of people and using data for attribution.

 

4.    Analyze the peer review data.
Examples of peer review data that can be analyzed include the following:

·       Phase defect was injected

·       Preparation time or rate versus expected time or rate

·       Number of defects versus number expected

·       Types of defects detected

·       Causes of defects

·       Defect resolution impact

SG 3            Verify Selected Work Products

Selected work products are verified against their specified requirements.

The verification methods, procedures, and criteria are used to verify the selected work products and any associated maintenance, training, and support services using the appropriate verification environment. Verification activities should be performed throughout the product lifecycle. Practices related to peer reviews as a specific verification method are included in specific goal 2.
SP 3.1         Perform Verification

Perform verification on the selected work products.

Verifying products and work products incrementally promotes early detection of problems and can result in the early removal of defects. The results of verification save considerable cost of fault isolation and rework associated with troubleshooting problems.

Typical Work Products

1.    Verification results

2.    Verification reports

3.    Demonstrations

4.    As-run procedures log

Subpractices

1.    Perform verification of selected work products against their requirements.

2.    Record the results of verification activities.

3.    Identify action items resulting from verification of work products.

4.    Document the “as-run” verification method and the deviations from the available methods and procedures discovered during its performance.
SP 3.2         Analyze Verification Results

Analyze the results of all verification activities.

Actual results must be compared to established verification criteria to determine acceptability.

The results of the analysis are recorded as evidence that verification was conducted.

For each work product, all available verification results are incrementally analyzed to ensure that the requirements have been met. Since a peer review is one of several verification methods, peer review data should be included in this analysis activity to ensure that the verification results are analyzed sufficiently. Analysis reports or “as-run” method documentation may also indicate that bad verification results are due to method problems, criteria problems, or a verification environment problem.

Typical Work Products

1.    Analysis report (e.g., statistics on performances, causal analysis of nonconformances, comparison of the behavior between the real product and models, and trends)

2.    Trouble reports

3.    Change requests for the verification methods, criteria, and environment

Subpractices

1.    Compare actual results to expected results.

2.    Based on the established verification criteria, identify products that have not met their requirements or identify problems with the methods, procedures, criteria, and verification environment

3.    Analyze the verification data on defects.

4.    Record all results of the analysis in a report.

5.    Use verification results to compare actual measurements and performance to technical performance parameters.

6.    Provide information on how defects can be resolved (including verification methods, criteria, and verification environment) and initiate corrective action.

Refer to the corrective action practices of Project Monitoring and Control process area for more information about implementing corrective action.

[]()[]()[]()D.       Glossary

The CMMI glossary defines the basic terms used in the CMMI models. Glossary entries are typically multiple-word terms consisting of a noun and one or more restrictive modifiers. (There are some exceptions to this rule that account for one-word terms in the glossary.)

To formulate definitions appropriate for CMMI, we consult multiple sources. We first consult Merriam-Webster OnLine dictionary (www.m-w.com) and the source models (i.e., EIA 731, SW-CMM v2, draft C, and IPD-CMM v0.98). We also consult other standards as needed, including the following:

·         ISO 9000 [ISO 1987]

·         ISO/IEC 12207 [ISO 1995]

·         ISO/IEC 15504 [ISO 2006]

·         ISO/IEC 15288 [ISO 2002b]

·         IEEE [IEEE 1990]

·         SW-CMM v1.1

·         EIA 632 [EIA 1994]

·         SA-CMM [SEI 2002c]

·         P-CMM [Curtis 2002]

We developed the glossary recognizing the importance of using terminology that all model users can understand. We also recognized that words and terms can have different meanings in different contexts and environments. The glossary in CMMI models is designed to document the meanings of words and terms that should have the widest use and understanding by users of CMMI products.
 
 
  acceptance criteria
 
The criteria that a product or product component must satisfy to be accepted by a user, customer, or other authorized entity. acceptance testing
 
Formal testing conducted to enable a user, customer, or other authorized entity to determine whether to accept a product or product component. (See also “unit testing.”) achievement profile
 
In the continuous representation, a list of process areas and their corresponding capability levels that represent the organization’s progress for each process area while advancing through the capability levels. (See also “capability level profile,” “target profile,” and “target staging.”) acquisition
 
The process of obtaining products (goods and services) through contract. acquisition strategy
 
The specific approach to acquiring products and services that is based on considerations of supply sources, acquisition methods, requirements specification types, contract or agreement types, and the related acquisition risk. addition
 
In the CMMI Product Suite, a clearly marked model component that contains information of interest to particular users. In a CMMI model, all additions bearing the same name (e.g., the IPPD addition) may be optionally selected as a group for use. adequate
 
This word is used so that you can interpret goals and practices in light of your organization’s business objectives. When using any CMMI model, you must interpret the practices so that they work for your organization. This term is used in goals and practices where certain activities may not be done all of the time. (See also “appropriate” and “as needed.”) allocated requirement
 
Requirement that levies all or part of the performance and functionality of a higher level requirement on a lower level architectural element or design component. alternative practice
 
A practice that is a substitute for one or more generic or specific practices contained in CMMI models that achieves an equivalent effect toward satisfying the generic or specific goal associated with model practices. Alternative practices are not necessarily one-for-one replacements for the generic or specific practices. amplification
 
Amplifications are informative model components that contain information relevant to a particular discipline. For example, to find an amplification for software engineering, you would look in the model for items labeled “For Software Engineering.” The same is true for other disciplines. appraisal
 
In the CMMI Product Suite, an examination of one or more processes by a trained team of professionals using an appraisal reference model as the basis for determining, at a minimum, strengths and weaknesses. (See also “assessment” and “capability evaluation.”) appraisal findings
 
The results of an appraisal that identify the most important issues, problems, or opportunities for process improvement within the appraisal scope. Appraisal findings are inferences drawn from corroborated objective evidence. appraisal participants
 
Members of the organizational unit who participate in providing information during the appraisal. appraisal rating
 
As used in CMMI appraisal materials, the value assigned by an appraisal team to (a) a CMMI goal or process area, (b) the capability level of a process area, or (c) the maturity level of an organizational unit. The rating is determined by enacting the defined rating process for the appraisal method being employed. appraisal reference model
 
As used in CMMI appraisal materials, the CMMI model to which an appraisal team correlates implemented process activities. appraisal scope
 
The definition of the boundaries of the appraisal encompassing the organizational limits and the CMMI model limits within which the processes to be investigated operate. appropriate
 
This word is used so that you can interpret goals and practices in light of your organization’s business objectives. When using any CMMI model, you must interpret the practices so that they work for your organization. This term is used in goals and practices where certain activities may not be done all of the time. (See also “adequate” and “as needed.”) as needed
 
This phrase is used so that you can interpret goals and practices in light of your organization’s business objectives. When using any CMMI model, you must interpret the practices so that they work for your organization. This term is used in goals and practices where certain activities may not be done all the time. (See also “adequate” and “appropriate.”) assessment
 
In the CMMI Product Suite, an appraisal that an organization does internally for the purposes of process improvement. The word assessment is also used in the CMMI Product Suite in an everyday English sense (e.g., risk assessment). (See also “appraisal” and “capability evaluation.”) assignable cause of process variation
 
In CMMI, the term special cause of process variation is used in place of assignable cause of process variation to ensure consistency. The two terms are defined identically. (See “special cause of process variation.”) audit
 
In CMMI process improvement work, an objective examination of a work product or set of work products against specific criteria (e.g., requirements). base measure
 
A distinct property or characteristic of an entity and the method for quantifying it. (See also “derived measures.”) baseline
 
A set of specifications or work products that has been formally reviewed and agreed on, which thereafter serves as the basis for further development, and which can be changed only through change control procedures. (See also “configuration baseline” and “product baseline.”) bidirectional traceability
 
An association among two or more logical entities that is discernable in either direction (i.e., to and from an entity). (See also “requirements traceability” and “traceability.”) business objectives
 
(See “organization’s business objectives.”) capability evaluation
 
An appraisal by a trained team of professionals used as a discriminator to select suppliers, to monitor suppliers against the contract, or to determine and enforce incentives. Evaluations are used to gain insight into the process capability of a supplier organization and are intended to help decision makers make better acquisition decisions, improve subcontractor performance, and provide insight to a purchasing organization. (See also “appraisal” and “assessment.”) capability level
 
Achievement of process improvement within an individual process area. A capability level is defined by the appropriate specific and generic practices for a process area. (See also “generic goal,” “generic practice,” “maturity level,” and “process area.”) capability level profile
 
In the continuous representation, a list of process areas and their corresponding capability levels. (See also “achievement profile,” “target profile,” and “target staging.”)

The profile may be an achievement profile when it represents the organization’s progress for each process area while advancing through the capability levels. Or, the profile may be a target profile when it represents an objective for process improvement. capability maturity model
 
A model that contains the essential elements of effective processes for one or more disciplines and describes an evolutionary improvement path from ad hoc, immature processes to disciplined, mature processes with improved quality and effectiveness. capable process
 
A process that can satisfy its specified product quality, service quality, and process-performance objectives. (See also “stable process,” “standard process,” and “statistically managed process.”) causal analysis
 
The analysis of defects to determine their cause. change management
 
Judicious use of means to effect a change, or a proposed change, on a product or service. (See also “configuration management.”) CMMI Framework
 
The basic structure that organizes CMMI components, including common elements of the current CMMI models as well as rules and methods for generating models, appraisal methods (including associated artifacts), and training materials. The framework enables new disciplines to be added to CMMI so that the new disciplines will integrate with the existing ones. (See also “CMMI model” and “CMMI Product Suite.”) CMMI model
 
One from the entire collection of possible models that can be generated from the CMMI Framework. Since the CMMI Framework can generate different models based on the needs of the organization using it, there are multiple CMMI models. (See also “CMMI Framework” and “CMMI Product Suite.”) CMMI model component
 
Any of the main architectural elements that compose a CMMI model. Some of the main elements of a CMMI model include specific practices, generic practices, specific goals, generic goals, process areas, capability levels, and maturity levels. CMMI Product Suite
 
The complete set of products developed around the CMMI concept. These products include the framework itself, models, appraisal methods, appraisal materials, and various types of training. (See also “CMMI Framework” and “CMMI model.”) common cause of process variation
 
The variation of a process that exists because of normal and expected interactions among the components of a process. (See also “special cause of process variation.”) concept of operations
 
(See “operational concept.”) configuration audit
 
An audit conducted to verify that a configuration item, or a collection of configuration items that make up a baseline, conforms to a specified standard or requirement. (See also “audit,” “configuration item,” “functional configuration audit,” and “physical configuration audit.”) configuration baseline
 
The configuration information formally designated at a specific time during a product’s or product component’s life. Configuration baselines, plus approved changes from those baselines, constitute the current configuration information. (See also “product lifecycle.”) configuration control
 
An element of configuration management consisting of the evaluation, coordination, approval or disapproval, and implementation of changes to configuration items after formal establishment of their configuration identification. (See also “configuration identification,” “configuration item,” and “configuration management.”) configuration control board
 
A group of people responsible for evaluating and approving or disapproving proposed changes to configuration items, and for ensuring implementation of approved changes. (See also “configuration item.”)

Configuration control boards are also known as change control boards. configuration identification
 
An element of configuration management consisting of selecting the configuration items for a product, assigning unique identifiers to them, and recording their functional and physical characteristics in technical documentation. (See also “configuration item,” “configuration management,” and “product.”) configuration item
 
An aggregation of work products that is designated for configuration management and treated as a single entity in the configuration management process. (See also “configuration management.”) configuration management
 
A discipline applying technical and administrative direction and surveillance to (1) identify and document the functional and physical characteristics of a configuration item, (2) control changes to those characteristics, (3) record and report change processing and implementation status, and (4) verify compliance with specified requirements. (See also “configuration audit,” “configuration control,” “configuration identification,” and “configuration status accounting.”) configuration status accounting
 
An element of configuration management consisting of the recording and reporting of information needed to manage a configuration effectively. This information includes a listing of the approved configuration identification, the status of proposed changes to the configuration, and the implementation status of approved changes. (See also “configuration identification” and “configuration management.”) continuous representation
 
A capability maturity model structure wherein capability levels provide a recommended order for approaching process improvement within each specified process area. (See also “capability level,” “process area,” and “staged representation.”) contractor
 
(See “supplier.”) corrective action
 
Acts or deeds used to remedy a situation, remove an error, or adjust a condition. COTS
 
Items that can be purchased from a commercial vendor. (COTS stands for commercial off the shelf.) customer
 
The party (individual, project, or organization) responsible for accepting the product or for authorizing payment. The customer is external to the project (except possibly when integrated teams are used, as in IPPD), but not necessarily external to the organization. The customer may be a higher level project. Customers are a subset of stakeholders. (See also “stakeholder.”)

In most cases where this term is used, the preceding definition is intended; however, in some contexts, the term “customer” is intended to include other relevant stakeholders. (See also “customer requirement.”) customer requirement
 
The result of eliciting, consolidating, and resolving conflicts among the needs, expectations, constraints, and interfaces of the product's relevant stakeholders in a way that is acceptable to the customer. (See also “customer.”) data
 
Recorded information, regardless of the form or method of recording, including technical data, computer software documents, financial information, management information, representation of facts, numbers, or datum of any nature that can be communicated, stored, and processed. data management
 
The disciplined processes and systems that plan for, acquire, and provide stewardship for business and technical data, consistent with data requirements, throughout the data lifecycle. defect density
 
Number of defects per unit of product size (e.g., problem reports per thousand lines of code). defined process
 
A managed process that is tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes according to the organization’s tailoring guidelines; has a maintained process description; and contributes work products, measures, and other process improvement information to the organizational process assets. (See also “managed process.”) derived measures
 
Data resulting from the mathematical function of two or more base measures. (See also “base measure.”) derived requirements
 
Requirements that are not explicitly stated in the customer requirements, but are inferred (1) from contextual requirements (e.g., applicable standards, laws, policies, common practices, and management decisions), or (2) from requirements needed to specify a product component. Derived requirements can also arise during analysis and design of components of the product or system. (See also “product requirements.”) design review
 
A formal, documented, comprehensive, and systematic examination of a design to evaluate the design requirements and the capability of the design to meet these requirements, and to identify problems and propose solutions. development
 
In the CMMI Product Suite, not only development activities but also maintenance activities may be included. Projects that benefit from the best practices of CMMI can focus on development, maintenance, or both. developmental plan
 
A plan for guiding, implementing, and controlling the design and development of one or more products. (See also “product lifecycle” and “project plan.”) discipline
 
In the CMMI Product Suite, the bodies of knowledge available to you when selecting a CMMI model (e.g., systems engineering). The CMMI Product Team envisions that other bodies of knowledge will be integrated into the CMMI Framework in the future. document
 
A collection of data, regardless of the medium on which it is recorded, that generally has permanence and can be read by humans or machines. So, documents include both paper and electronic documents. enterprise
 
The full composition of companies. Companies may consist of many organizations in many locations with different customers. (See also “organization.”) entry criteria
 
States of being that must be present before an effort can begin successfully. equivalent staging
 
A target staging, created using the continuous representation, which is defined so that the results of using the target staging can be compared to the maturity levels of the staged representation. (See also “capability level profile,” “maturity level,” “target profile,” and “target staging.”)

Such staging permits benchmarking of progress among organizations, enterprises, and projects, regardless of the CMMI representation used. The organization may implement components of CMMI models beyond those reported as part of equivalent staging. Equivalent staging is only a measure to relate how the organization is compared to other organizations in terms of maturity levels. establish and maintain
 
In the CMMI Product Suite, you will encounter goals and practices that include the phrase “establish and maintain.” This phrase means more than a combination of its component terms; it includes documentation and usage. For example, “Establish and maintain an organizational policy for planning and performing the organizational process focus process” means that not only must a policy be formulated, but it also must be documented, and it must be used throughout the organization. evidence
 
(See “objective evidence.”) executive
 
(See “senior manager.”) exit criteria
 
States of being that must be present before an effort can end successfully. expected CMMI components
 
CMMI components that explain what may be done to satisfy a required CMMI component. Model users can implement the expected components explicitly or implement equivalent alternative practices to these components. Specific and generic practices are expected model components. finding
 
(See “appraisal findings.”) formal evaluation process
 
A structured approach to evaluating alternative solutions against established criteria to determine a recommended solution to address an issue. framework
 
(See “CMMI Framework.”) functional analysis
 
Examination of a defined function to identify all the subfunctions necessary to the accomplishment of that function; identification of functional relationships and interfaces (internal and external) and capturing these in a functional architecture; and flow down of upper level performance requirements and assignment of these requirements to lower level subfunctions. (See also “functional architecture.”) functional architecture
 
The hierarchical arrangement of functions, their internal and external (external to the aggregation itself) functional interfaces and external physical interfaces, their respective functional and performance requirements, and their design constraints. functional configuration audit
 
An audit conducted to verify that the development of a configuration item has been completed satisfactorily, that the item has achieved the performance and functional characteristics specified in the functional or allocated configuration identification, and that its operational and support documents are complete and satisfactory. (See also “configuration audit,” “configuration management,” and “physical configuration audit.”) generic goal
 
A required model component that describes the characteristics that must be present to institutionalize the processes that implement a process area. (See also “institutionalization.”) generic practice
 
An expected model component that is considered important in achieving the associated generic goal. The generic practices associated with a generic goal describe the activities that are expected to result in achievement of the generic goal and contribute to the institutionalization of the processes associated with a process area. generic practice elaboration
 
An informative model component that appears after a generic practice to provide guidance on how the generic practice should be applied to the process area. goal
 
A required CMMI component that can be either a generic goal or a specific goal. When you see the word goal in a CMMI model, it always refers to a model component (e.g., generic goal and specific goal). (See also “generic goal,” “objective,” and “specific goal.”) hardware engineering
 
The application of a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to transform a set of requirements representing the collection of stakeholder needs, expectations, and constraints using documented techniques and technology to design, implement, and maintain a tangible product. (See also “software engineering” and “systems engineering.”)

In CMMI, hardware engineering represents all technical fields (e.g., electrical or mechanical) that transform requirements and ideas into tangible and producible products. higher level management
 
The person or persons who provide the policy and overall guidance for the process, but do not provide the direct day-to-day monitoring and controlling of the process. Such persons belong to a level of management in the organization above the immediate level responsible for the process and can be (but are not necessarily) senior managers. (See also “senior manager.”) incomplete process
 
A process that is not performed or is performed only partially (also known as capability level 0). One or more of the specific goals of the process area are not satisfied. informative CMMI components
 
CMMI components that help model users understand the required and expected components of a model. These components can contain examples, detailed explanations, or other helpful information. Subpractices, notes, references, goal titles, practice titles, sources, typical work products, amplifications, and generic practice elaborations are informative model components. institutionalization
 
The ingrained way of doing business that an organization follows routinely as part of its corporate culture. integrated product and process development
 
A systematic approach to product development that achieves a timely collaboration of relevant stakeholders throughout the product lifecycle to better satisfy customer needs. integrated team
 
A group of people with complementary skills and expertise who are committed to delivering specified work products in timely collaboration. Integrated team members provide skills and advocacy appropriate to all phases of the work products’ life and are collectively responsible for delivering the work products as specified. An integrated team should include empowered representatives from organizations, disciplines, and functions that have a stake in the success of the work products. interface control
 
In configuration management, the process of (1) identifying all functional and physical characteristics relevant to the interfacing of two or more configuration items provided by one or more organizations, and (2) ensuring that the proposed changes to these characteristics are evaluated and approved prior to implementation. (See also “configuration item” and “configuration management.”) lifecycle model
 
A partitioning of the life of a product or project into phases. managed process
 
A performed process that is planned and executed in accordance with policy; employs skilled people having adequate resources to produce controlled outputs; involves relevant stakeholders; is monitored, controlled, and reviewed; and is evaluated for adherence to its process description. (See also “performed process.”) manager
 
In the CMMI Product Suite, a person who provides technical and administrative direction and control to those performing tasks or activities within the manager’s area of responsibility. The traditional functions of a manager include planning, organizing, directing, and controlling work within an area of responsibility. maturity level
 
Degree of process improvement across a predefined set of process areas in which all goals in the set are attained. (See also “capability level” and “process area.”) memorandum of agreement
 
Binding documents of understanding or agreements between two or more parties. Also known as a “memorandum of understanding.” natural bounds
 
The inherent process reflected by measures of process performance, sometimes referred to as “voice of the process.” Techniques such as control charts, confidence intervals, and prediction intervals are used to determine whether the variation is due to common causes (i.e., the process is predictable or “stable”) or is due to some special cause that can and should be identified and removed. nondevelopmental item (NDI)
 
An item of supply that was developed prior to its current use in an acquisition or development process. Such an item may require minor modifications to meet the requirements of its current intended use. nontechnical requirements
 
Contractual provisions, commitments, conditions, and terms that affect how products or services are to be acquired. Examples include products to be delivered, data rights for delivered commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) nondevelopmental items (NDIs), delivery dates, and milestones with exit criteria. Other nontechnical requirements include training requirements, site requirements, and deployment schedules. objective
 
When used as a noun in the CMMI Product Suite, the term objective replaces the word goal as used in its common everyday sense since the word goal is reserved for use when referring to the CMMI model components called specific goals and generic goals. (See also “goal.”) objective evidence
 
As used in CMMI appraisal materials, documents or interview results used as indicators of the implementation or institutionalization of model practices. Sources of objective evidence can include instruments, presentations, documents, and interviews. objectively evaluate
 
To review activities and work products against criteria which minimize subjectivity and bias by the reviewer. An example of an objective evaluation is an audit against requirements, standards, or procedures by an independent quality assurance function. (See also “audit.”) observation
 
As used in CMMI appraisal materials, a written record that represents the appraisal team members’ understanding of information either seen or heard during the appraisal data collection activities. The written record may take the form of a statement or may take alternative forms as long as the information content is preserved. operational concept
 
A general description of the way in which an entity is used or operates. (Also known as “concept of operations.”) operational scenario
 
A description of an imagined sequence of events that includes the interaction of the product with its environment and users, as well as interaction among its product components. Operational scenarios are used to evaluate the requirements and design of the system and to verify and validate the system. optimizing process
 
A quantitatively managed process that is improved based on an understanding of the common causes of variation inherent in the process. The focus of an optimizing process is on continually improving the range of process performance through both incremental and innovative improvements. (See also “common cause of process variation,” “defined process,” and “quantitatively managed process.”) organization
 
An administrative structure in which people collectively manage one or more projects as a whole, and whose projects share a senior manager and operate under the same policies. However, the word organization as used throughout CMMI models can also apply to one person who performs a function in a small organization that might be performed by a group of people in a large organization. (See also “enterprise” and “organizational unit.”) organizational maturity
 
The extent to which an organization has explicitly and consistently deployed processes that are documented, managed, measured, controlled, and continually improved. Organizational maturity may be measured via appraisals. organizational policy
 
A guiding principle typically established by senior management that is adopted by an organization to influence and determine decisions. organizational process assets
 
Artifacts that relate to describing, implementing, and improving processes (e.g., policies, measurements, process descriptions, and process implementation support tools). The term process assets is used to indicate that these artifacts are developed or acquired to meet the business objectives of the organization, and they represent investments by the organization that are expected to provide current and future business value. (See also “process asset library.”) organizational unit
 
The part of an organization that is the subject of an appraisal. An organizational unit deploys one or more processes that have a coherent process context and operates within a coherent set of business objectives. An organizational unit is typically part of a larger organization, although in a small organization, the organizational unit may be the whole organization. organization's business objectives
 
Senior management developed strategies designed to ensure an organization’s continued existence and enhance its profitability, market share, and other factors influencing the organization’s success. (See also “quality and process-performance objectives” and “quantitative objective.”)

Such objectives may include reducing the number of change requests during a system’s integration phase, reducing development cycle time, increasing the number of errors found in a product’s first or second phase of development, and reducing the number of customer-reported defects, when applied to systems engineering activities. organization's measurement repository
 
A repository used to collect and make available measurement data on processes and work products, particularly as they relate to the organization’s set of standard processes. This repository contains or references actual measurement data and related information needed to understand and analyze the measurement data. organization's process asset library
 
A library of information used to store and make available process assets that are useful to those who are defining, implementing, and managing processes in the organization. This library contains process assets that include process-related documentation such as policies, defined processes, checklists, lessons-learned documents, templates, standards, procedures, plans, and training materials. organization's set of standard processes
 
A collection of definitions of the processes that guide activities in an organization. These process descriptions cover the fundamental process elements (and their relationships to each other, such as ordering and interfaces) that must be incorporated into the defined processes that are implemented in projects across the organization. A standard process enables consistent development and maintenance activities across the organization and is essential for long-term stability and improvement. (See also “defined process” and “process element.”) outsourcing
 
(See “acquisition.”) peer review
 
The review of work products performed by peers during development of the work products to identify defects for removal. The term peer review is used in the CMMI Product Suite instead of the term work product inspection. (See also “work product.”) performance parameters
 
The measures of effectiveness and other key measures used to guide and control progressive development. performed process
 
A process that accomplishes the needed work to produce work products. The specific goals of the process area are satisfied. physical configuration audit
 
An audit conducted to verify that a configuration item, as built, conforms to the technical documentation that defines and describes it. (See also, “configuration audit,” “configuration management,” and “functional configuration audit.”) planned process
 
A process that is documented by both a description and a plan. The description and plan should be coordinated, and the plan should include standards, requirements, objectives, resources, assignments, and so on. policy
 
(See “organizational policy.”) process
 
In the CMMI Product Suite, activities that can be recognized as implementations of practices in a CMMI model. These activities can be mapped to one or more practices in CMMI process areas to allow a model to be useful for process improvement and process appraisal. (See also “process area,” “subprocess,” and “process element.”)

There is a special use of the phrase “the process” in the statements and descriptions of the generic goals and generic practices. “The process,” as used in Part Two, is the process or processes that implement the process area. process action plan
 
A plan, usually resulting from appraisals, that documents how specific improvements targeting the weaknesses uncovered by an appraisal will be implemented. process action team
 
A team that has the responsibility to develop and implement process improvement activities for an organization as documented in a process action plan. process and technology improvements
 
Incremental and innovative improvements to processes and to process or product technologies. process architecture
 
The ordering, interfaces, interdependencies, and other relationships among the process elements in a standard process. Process architecture also describes the interfaces, interdependencies, and other relationships between process elements and external processes (e.g., contract management). process area
 
A cluster of related practices in an area that, when implemented collectively, satisfy a set of goals considered important for making improvement in that area. All CMMI process areas are common to both continuous and staged representations. process asset
 
Anything that the organization considers useful in attaining the goals of a process area. (See also “organizational process assets.”) process asset library
 
A collection of process asset holdings that can be used by an organization or project. (See also “organization’s process asset library.”) process attribute
 
A measurable characteristic of process capability applicable to any process. process capability
 
The range of expected results that can be achieved by following a process. process definition
 
The act of defining and describing a process. The result of a process definition is a process description. (See also “process description.”) process description
 
A documented expression of a set of activities performed to achieve a given purpose.

A process description provides an operational definition of the major components of a process. The description specifies, in a complete, precise, and verifiable manner, the requirements, design, behavior, or other characteristics of a process. It also may include procedures for determining whether these provisions have been satisfied. Process descriptions can be found at the activity, project, or organizational level. process element
 
The fundamental unit of a process. A process can be defined in terms of subprocesses or process elements. A subprocess can be further decomposed into subprocesses or process elements; a process element cannot. (See also “process” and “subprocess.”)

Each process element covers a closely related set of activities (e.g., estimating element and peer review element). Process elements can be portrayed using templates to be completed, abstractions to be refined, or descriptions to be modified or used. A process element can be an activity or task. process group
 
A collection of specialists who facilitate the definition, maintenance, and improvement of the processes used by the organization. process improvement
 
A program of activities designed to improve the performance and maturity of the organization’s processes and the results of such a program. process improvement objectives
 
A set of target characteristics established to guide the effort to improve an existing process in a specific, measurable way either in terms of resultant product characteristics (e.g., quality, performance, and conformance to standards) or in the way in which the process is executed (e.g., elimination of redundant process steps, combination of process steps, and improvement of cycle time). (See also “organization’s business objectives” and “quantitative objective.”) process improvement plan
 
A plan for achieving organizational process improvement objectives based on a thorough understanding of the current strengths and weaknesses of the organization’s processes and process assets. process measurement
 
The set of definitions, methods, and activities used to take measurements of a process and its resulting products for the purpose of characterizing and understanding the process. process owner
 
The person (or team) responsible for defining and maintaining a process. At the organizational level, the process owner is the person (or team) responsible for the description of a standard process; at the project level, the process owner is the person (or team) responsible for the description of the defined process. A process may therefore have multiple owners at different levels of responsibility. (See also “defined process” and “standard process.”) process performance
 
A measure of actual results achieved by following a process. It is characterized by both process measures (e.g., effort, cycle time, and defect removal efficiency) and product measures (e.g., reliability, defect density, and response time). process-performance baseline
 
A documented characterization of the actual results achieved by following a process, which is used as a benchmark for comparing actual process performance against expected process performance. (See also “process performance.”) process-performance model
 
A description of the relationships among attributes of a process and its work products that is developed from historical process-performance data and calibrated using collected process and product measures from the project and that is used to predict results to be achieved by following a process. process tailoring
 
Making, altering, or adapting a process description for a particular end. For example, a project tailors its defined process from the organization’s set of standard processes to meet the objectives, constraints, and environment of the project. (See also “defined process,” “organization’s set of standard processes,” and “process description.”) product
 
In the CMMI Product Suite, a work product that is intended for delivery to a customer or end user. The form of a product can vary in different contexts. (See also “customer,” “product component,” “service,” and “work product.”) product baseline
 
In configuration management, the initial approved technical data package (including, for software, the source code listing) defining a configuration item during the production, operation, maintenance, and logistic support of its lifecycle. (See also “configuration item” and “configuration management.”) product component
 
In the CMMI Product Suite, a work product that is a lower level component of the product. Product components are integrated to produce the product. There may be multiple levels of product components. (See also “product” and “work product.”) product component requirements
 
A complete specification of a product component, including fit, form, function, performance, and any other requirement. product lifecycle
 
The period of time, consisting of phases, which begins when a product is conceived and ends when the product is no longer available for use. Since an organization may be producing multiple products for multiple customers, one description of a product lifecycle may not be adequate. Therefore, the organization may define a set of approved product lifecycle models. These models are typically found in published literature and are likely to be tailored for use in an organization.

A product lifecycle could consist of the following phases: (1) concept/vision, (2) feasibility, (3) design/development, (4) production, and (5) phase out. product line
 
A group of products sharing a common, managed set of features that satisfy specific needs of a selected market or mission. product-related lifecycle processes
 
Processes associated with a product throughout one or more phases of its life (e.g., from conception through disposal), such as the manufacturing and support processes. product requirements
 
A refinement of the customer requirements into the developers’ language, making implicit requirements into explicit derived requirements. (See also “derived requirements” and “product component requirements.”)

The developer uses the product requirements to guide the design and building of the product. product suite
 
(See “CMMI Product Suite.”) profile
 
(See “achievement profile” and “target profile.”) program
 
(1) A project. (2) A collection of related projects and the infrastructure that supports them, including objectives, methods, activities, plans, and success measures. (See also “project.”) project
 
In the CMMI Product Suite, a managed set of interrelated resources which delivers one or more products to a customer or end user. A project has a definite beginning (i.e., project startup) and typically operates according to a plan. Such a plan is frequently documented and specifies what is to be delivered or implemented, the resources and funds to be used, the work to be done, and a schedule for doing the work. A project can be composed of projects. (See also “project startup.”) project manager
 
In the CMMI Product Suite, the person responsible for planning, directing, controlling, structuring, and motivating the project. The project manager is responsible for satisfying the customer. project plan
 
A plan that provides the basis for performing and controlling the project’s activities, which addresses the commitments to the project’s customer.

Project planning includes estimating the attributes of the work products and tasks, determining the resources needed, negotiating commitments, producing a schedule, and identifying and analyzing project risks. Iterating through these activities may be necessary to establish the project plan. project progress and performance
 
What a project achieves with respect to implementing project plans, including effort, cost, schedule, and technical performance. project startup
 
When a set of interrelated resources are directed to develop or deliver one or more products for a customer or end user. (See also “project.”) project's defined process
 
The integrated and defined process that is tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes. (See also “defined process.”) prototype
 
A preliminary type, form, or instance of a product or product component that serves as a model for later stages or for the final, complete version of the product. This model (e.g., physical, electronic, digital, and analytical) can be used for the following (and other) purposes:

·         Assessing the feasibility of a new or unfamiliar technology

·         Assessing or mitigating technical risk

·         Validating requirements

·         Demonstrating critical features

·         Qualifying a product

·         Qualifying a process

·         Characterizing performance or product features

·         Elucidating physical principles quality
 
The ability of a set of inherent characteristics of a product, product component, or process to fulfill requirements of customers. quality and process-performance objectives
 
Objectives and requirements for product quality, service quality, and process performance. Process-performance objectives include quality; however, to emphasize the importance of quality in the CMMI Product Suite, the phrase quality and process-performance objectives is used rather than just process-performance objectives. quality assurance
 
A planned and systematic means for assuring management that the defined standards, practices, procedures, and methods of the process are applied. quality control
 
The operational techniques and activities that are used to fulfill requirements for quality. (See also “quality assurance.”) quantitative objective
 
Desired target value expressed as quantitative measures. (See also “process improvement objectives” and “quality and process-performance objectives.”) quantitatively managed process
 
A defined process that is controlled using statistical and other quantitative techniques. The product quality, service quality, and process-performance attributes are measurable and controlled throughout the project. (See also “defined process,” “optimizing process,” and “statistically managed process.”) rating
 
(See “appraisal rating.”) reference
 
An informative model component that points to additional or more detailed information in related process areas. reference model
 
A model that is used as a benchmark for measuring some attribute. relevant stakeholder
 
A stakeholder that is identified for involvement in specified activities and is included in a plan. (See also “stakeholder.”) representation
 
The organization, use, and presentation of a CMM’s components. Overall, two types of approaches to presenting best practices are evident: the staged representation and the continuous representation. required CMMI components
 
CMMI components that are essential to achieving process improvement in a given process area. These components are used in appraisals to determine process capability. Specific goals and generic goals are required model components. requirement
 
(1) A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective. (2) A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a product or product component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed documents. (3) A documented representation of a condition or capability as in (1) or (2). requirements analysis
 
The determination of product-specific performance and functional characteristics based on analyses of customer needs, expectations, and constraints; operational concept; projected utilization environments for people, products, and processes; and measures of effectiveness. requirements elicitation
 
Using systematic techniques, such as prototypes and structured surveys, to proactively identify and document customer and end-user needs. requirements management
 
The management of all requirements received by or generated by the project, including both technical and nontechnical requirements as well as those requirements levied on the project by the organization. requirements traceability
 
A discernable association between requirements and related requirements, implementations, and verifications. (See also “bidirectional traceability” and “traceability.”) return on investment
 
The ratio of revenue from output (product) to production costs, which determines whether an organization benefits from performing an action to produce something. risk analysis
 
The evaluation, classification, and prioritization of risks. risk identification
 
An organized, thorough approach to seek out probable or realistic risks in achieving objectives. risk management
 
An organized, analytic process to identify what might cause harm or loss (identify risks); to assess and quantify the identified risks; and to develop and, if needed, implement an appropriate approach to prevent or handle causes of risk that could result in significant harm or loss. risk management strategy
 
An organized, technical approach to identify what might cause harm or loss (identify risks); to assess and quantify the identified risks; and to develop and, if needed, implement an appropriate approach to prevent or handle causes of risk that could result in significant harm or loss. Typically, risk management is performed for project, organization, or product developing organizational units. root cause
 
A source of a defect such that if it is removed, the defect is decreased or removed. senior manager
 
In the CMMI Product Suite, a management role at a high enough level in an organization that the primary focus of the person filling the role is the long-term vitality of the organization rather than short-term project and contractual concerns and pressures. A senior manager has authority to direct the allocation or reallocation of resources in support of organizational process improvement effectiveness. (See also “higher level management.”)

A senior manager can be any manager who satisfies this description, including the head of the organization. Synonyms for “senior manager” include “executive” and “top-level manager.” However, to ensure consistency and usability, these synonyms are not used in CMMI models. service
 
In the CMMI Product Suite, a service is a product that is intangible and non-storable. (See also “product,” “customer,” and “work product.”) shared vision
 
A common understanding of guiding principles including mission, objectives, expected behavior, values, and final outcomes, which are developed and used by a project. software engineering
 
(1) The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. (2) The study of approaches as in (1). (See also “hardware engineering,” and “systems engineering.”) solicitation
 
The process of preparing a package to be used in selecting a supplier (contractor). special cause of process variation
 
A cause of a defect that is specific to some transient circumstance and not an inherent part of a process. (See also “common cause of process variation.”) specific goal
 
A required model component that describes the unique characteristics that must be present to satisfy the process area. (See also “capability level,” “generic goal,” “organization’s business objectives,” and “process area.”) specific practice
 
An expected model component that is considered important in achieving the associated specific goal. The specific practices describe the activities expected to result in achievement of the specific goals of a process area. (See also “process area” and “specific goal.”) stable process
 
The state in which all special causes of process variation have been removed and prevented from recurring so that only the common causes of process variation of the process remain. (See also “capable process,” “common cause of process variation,” “special cause of process variation,” “standard process,” and “statistically managed process.”) staged representation
 
A model structure wherein attaining the goals of a set of process areas establishes a maturity level; each level builds a foundation for subsequent levels. (See also “maturity level” and “process area.”) stakeholder
 
In the CMMI Product Suite, a group or individual that is affected by or is in some way accountable for the outcome of an undertaking. Stakeholders may include project members, suppliers, customers, end users, and others. (See also “customer” and “relevant stakeholder.”) standard
 
When you see the word standard used as a noun in a CMMI model, it refers to the formal mandatory requirements developed and used to prescribe consistent approaches to development (e.g., ISO/IEC standards, IEEE standards, and organizational standards). Instead of using standard in its common everyday sense, we use another term that means the same thing (e.g., typical, traditional, usual, or customary). standard process
 
An operational definition of the basic process that guides the establishment of a common process in an organization.

A standard process describes the fundamental process elements that are expected to be incorporated into any defined process. It also describes the relationships (e.g., ordering and interfaces) among these process elements. (See also “defined process.”) statement of work
 
A description of contracted work required to complete a project. statistical predictability
 
The performance of a quantitative process that is controlled using statistical and other quantitative techniques. statistical process control
 
Statistically based analysis of a process and measurements of process performance, which will identify common and special causes of variation in the process performance and maintain process performance within limits. (See also “common cause of process variation,” “special cause of process variation,” and “statistically managed process.”) statistical techniques
 
An analytic technique that employs statistical methods (e.g., statistical process control, confidence intervals, and prediction intervals). statistically managed process
 
A process that is managed by a statistically based technique in which processes are analyzed, special causes of process variation are identified, and performance is contained within well-defined limits. (See also “capable process,” “special cause of process variation,” “stable process,” “standard process,” and “statistical process control.”) subpractice
 
An informative model component that provides guidance for interpreting and implementing a specific or generic practice. Subpractices may be worded as if prescriptive, but are actually meant only to provide ideas that may be useful for process improvement. subprocess
 
A process that is part of a larger process. A subprocess can be decomposed into subprocesses and/or process elements. (See also “process,” “process description,” and “process element.”) supplier
 
(1) An entity delivering products or performing services being acquired. (2) An individual, partnership, company, corporation, association, or other service having an agreement (contract) with an acquirer for the design, development, manufacture, maintenance, modification, or supply of items under the terms of an agreement (contract). sustainment
 
The processes used to ensure that a product can be utilized operationally by its end users or customers. Sustainment ensures that maintenance is done such that the product is in an operable condition whether or not the product is in use by customers or end users. systems engineering
 
The interdisciplinary approach governing the total technical and managerial effort required to transform a set of customer needs, expectations, and constraints into a product solution and to support that solution throughout the product’s life. (See also “hardware engineering” and “software engineering.”)

This includes the definition of technical performance measures, the integration of engineering specialties toward the establishment of a product architecture, and the definition of supporting lifecycle processes that balance cost, performance, and schedule objectives. tailoring
 
Tailoring a process makes, alters, or adapts the process description for a particular end. For example, a project establishes its defined process by tailoring from the organization’s set of standard processes to meet the objectives, constraints, and environment of the project. tailoring guidelines
 
Organizational guidelines that enable projects, groups, and organizational functions to appropriately adapt standard processes for their use. The organization’s set of standard processes is described at a general level that may not be directly usable to perform a process.

Tailoring guidelines aid those who establish the defined processes for projects. Tailoring guidelines cover (1) selecting a standard process, (2) selecting an approved lifecycle model, and (3) tailoring the selected standard process and lifecycle model to fit project needs. Tailoring guidelines describe what can and cannot be modified and identify process components that are candidates for modification. target profile
 
In the continuous representation, a list of process areas and their corresponding capability levels that represent an objective for process improvement. (See also “achievement profile” and “capability level profile.”) target staging
 
In the continuous representation, a sequence of target profiles that describes the path of process improvement to be followed by the organization. (See also “achievement profile,” “capability level profile,” and “target profile.”) technical data package
 
A collection of items that can include the following if such information is appropriate to the type of product and product component (e.g., material and manufacturing requirements may not be useful for product components associated with software services or processes):

·         Product architecture description

·         Allocated requirements

·         Product component descriptions

·         Product-related lifecycle process descriptions if not described as separate product components

·         Key product characteristics

·         Required physical characteristics and constraints

·         Interface requirements

·         Materials requirements (bills of material and material characteristics)

·         Fabrication and manufacturing requirements (for both the original equipment manufacturer and field support)

·         Verification criteria used to ensure requirements have been achieved

·         Conditions of use (environments) and operating/usage scenarios, modes and states for operations, support, training, manufacturing, disposal, and verifications throughout the life of the product

·         Rationale for decisions and characteristics (e.g., requirements, requirement allocations, and design choices) technical requirements
 
Properties (attributes) of products or services to be acquired or developed. test procedure
 
Detailed instructions for the setup, execution, and evaluation of results for a given test. traceability
 
A discernable association among two or more logical entities such as requirements, system elements, verifications, or tasks. (See also “bidirectional traceability” and “requirements traceability.”) trade study
 
An evaluation of alternatives, based on criteria and systematic analysis, to select the best alternative for attaining determined objectives. training
 
Formal and informal learning options, which may include in-class training, informal mentoring, Web-based training, guided self-study, and formalized on-the-job training programs. The learning options selected for each situation are based on an assessment of the need for training and the performance gap to be addressed. typical work product
 
An informative model component that provides sample outputs from a specific practice. These examples are called typical work products because there are often other work products that are just as effective but are not listed. unit testing
 
Testing of individual hardware or software units or groups of related units. (See also “acceptance testing.”) validation
 
Confirmation that the product, as provided (or as it will be provided), will fulfill its intended use. In other words, validation ensures that “you built the right thing.” (See also “verification.”) verification
 
Confirmation that work products properly reflect the requirements specified for them. In other words, verification ensures that “you built it right.” (See also “validation.”) version control
 
The establishment and maintenance of baselines and the identification of changes to baselines that make it possible to return to the previous baseline. work breakdown structure (WBS)
 
An arrangement of work elements and their relationship to each other and to the end product. work product
 
In the CMMI Product Suite, a useful result of a process. This can include files, documents, products, parts of a product, services, process descriptions, specifications, and invoices. A key distinction between a work product and a product component is that a work product is not necessarily part of the product. (See also “product” and “product component.”)

In CMMI models, you will see the phrase work products and services. Even though the definition of work product includes services, this phrase is used to emphasize the inclusion of services in the discussion. work product and task attributes
 
Characteristics of products, services, and project tasks used to help in estimating project work. These characteristics include items such as size, complexity, weight, form, fit, and function. They are typically used as one input to deriving other project and resource estimates (e.g., effort, cost, and schedule). ****

CMMI® for Development (CMMI-DEV), Version 1.2 is an upgrade of CMMI-SE/SW/IPPD/SS, Version 1.1. The focus of the CMMI Version 1.2 effort is on improving the quality of CMMI products and the consistency of how they are applied. This report represents the model portion of the CMMI Product Suite. Other portions of the CMMI Product Suite include the SCAMPI A appraisal method and the Introduction to CMMI training course.

CMMI now includes the concept of CMMI “constellations.” A constellation is a set of CMMI components designed to meet the needs of a specific area of interest. A constellation can produce one or more related CMMI models and related appraisal and training materials. CMMI for Development is the first of these constellations.

This report contains the two models that comprise the CMMI for Development constellation: the CMMI for Development and CMMI for Development +IPPD models. The report consists of three parts. Part one is the overview, which describes CMMI concepts, model components, and guidance on using the CMMI Product Suite. Part two contains the generic goals and practices and process areas, which are used by organizations to improve their development processes. Part three contains references, acronyms, project participants, and a glossary. 14.  subject terms

[[1]]() The CMMI Framework is the basic structure that organizes CMMI components and combines them into CMMI constellations and models.

[[2]]() An appraisal is an examination of one or more processes by a trained team of professionals using a reference model (e.g., CMMI) as the basis for determining strengths and weaknesses.
[[3]]() The SEI Web site is located at http://www.sei.cmu.edu.

[[4]]() A “process area” is a cluster of related best practices in an area, which when implemented collectively, satisfy a set of goals considered important for making significant improvement in that area. We will cover this concept in detail in Chapter 2.
[[5]]() The Systems Engineering Capability Model is also known as Electronic Industries Alliance 731 (EIA 731).

[[6]]() This process area has "+IPPD" after its name because it contains a goal and practices that are specific to IPPD. The material specific to IPPD is called an "IPPD addition." All process areas with IPPD additions have "+IPPD" after their name.
[[7]]() For more information about appraisals, refer to Appraisal Requirements for CMMI and the Standard CMMI Appraisal Method for Process Improvement Method Definition Document [SEI 2006a, SEI 2006b].

[[8]]() The SCAMPI method is described in chapter 5.
[[9]]() See Table 6.2 on page 95 in the Generic Goals and Generic Practices section for more information about the dependencies between generic practices and process areas.

[[10]]() Organizational Process Definition (OPD) has one goal that applies only when using CMMI with the IPPD group of additions.
[[11]]() Integrated Project Management (IPM) has one goal that applies only when using CMMI with the IPPD group of additions.

[[12]]() See the glossary for the definition of CMMI Product Suite.
[[13]]() Experience has shown that the most critical factor influencing successful process improvement and appraisals is senior management sponsorship.

[[14]]() When the relationship between a generic practice and a process area is less direct, the risk of confusion is reduced; therefore, we do not describe all recursive relationships in the table (e.g., for generic practices 2.3, 2.4, and 2.10).
